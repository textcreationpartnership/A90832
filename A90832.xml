            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Man cannot do, nor be a doer of the will and Commandement of God, (as to believe, love, repent, and the reſt) by the help and ſtrengthning of Chriſt; for if he could, and ſhould do, or be a doer of the work, he ſhould have wages, and might challenge a debt of God, a ſhare in the work: To him ſaith the Apoſtle that <note place="margin">

            <p>Now the Apoſtle ſaith, all the goodneſſe of God to man is of grace, not of debt for his work &amp; doing of the wil and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God: we (ſaith he) are juſtified freely by his grace, by the grace of God I am that I am (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> by Chriſts grace ye <note place="margin">

And further, theſe ſaying that they are able to do the will and Commandement of God by the help of Chriſt, &amp;c. do much exalt themſelves, and diſhonor Chriſt, and his undertaking of doing the whole will of God for poor corrupt and unable man: for they make themſelves the principal doers of the will and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and Chriſt but their helper, their auxiliary: a helper is not the principall in any thing.</p>

            <p>The Doctrine here held forth of Chriſt is this, <hi>That all that call themſelves Chriſtians ought to deny themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things to be conſidered. 1. What it is to deny our ſelves. 2. The myſtery and ſtrangeneſſe thereof to naturall man.</p>
            <p>For the firſt to deny a mans ſelf, is not meant of Chriſt, that a a man ſhould deny himſelf to be that which he is in truth, or to have that which he hath in truth, or to do that which he doth in truth. But to deny a mans ſelf here intended of Chriſt, is to deny himſelf to be that which he thinketh himſelf to be, and is not in truth; and to deny himſelf to have that, which he thinketh himſelfe to have, and hath not in truth; and to deny himſelfe to doe that which he thinketh himſelfe to doe, and doth not in truth: wherein theſe particulars are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118157:8"/>
ſpecially to be good, holy, wiſe, juſt and righteous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: To have goodneſſe, holineſſe, wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. in himſelf. To do good &amp;c. himſelf, or at leaſt to behave and do ſomewhat of theſe, &amp;c. And there is no man in this his corrupt eſtate, but thinketh himſelf verily to be all theſe, to have all theſe, and to do all theſe before God, or at leaſt to behave, and to do ſomewhat of all theſe, which he neither is, hath, nor doth, nor can do in himſelf before God, no not in the leaſt of any of them, as ſhall be made plain.</p>

            <p>And ſome held forth the commandement thus, only the curſe and commination thereof to be taken away, to Gods choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Chriſt, but that they are ſtill bounp to do the command, to indeavour rnd do ſomething thereof themſelves before God, that the commandements remain ſtil as a rule for them to follow, in Gods ſight, to pleaſe God, to enjoy life, to come to the Father, without which (themſelves indeavouring and doing) they cannot come to the Father in heaven. But (I take it) they might more truly ſay, by ſuch indeavouring and doing the command them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, no man ſhall, or can come to the Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

            <p>If any man therefore holdeth himſelf forth to pleaſe God, to climbe up to the Father, by his own indeavours, devotions, and performances, he robbeth Chriſt of his honor, of the honor only due to him, and therefore ſaith Chriſt, he is a thiefe and a robber.</p>
            <p>If a King ſhould for ſpeciall love and ſervice done to him, give to his ſon that honor, that no man ſhould come to him into his preſence, but by this his Son.

               <p>Mark this well, When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had fiery Serpents among them, which ſtung many to death, God by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet up a Brazen <note place="margin">

               <p>But afterward the people made it an Idol, burnt incenſe to it, accounting the goodneſs and vertue whereby they healed to be in the Serpent of Braſs, not in Jeſus Chriſt, which it figured; therefore the ſervant and Inſtrument of God, King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>

               <p>Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet up Prayer in the room of the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to his church and people, to be a figure and repreſentation of himſelf unto them, that if we his people will return unto prayer according to his Ordinance, and look upon him repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prayer (as he hath commanded,) then we ſhall all of us be ſure to be healed, as all were healed that were ſtung by the fiery Serpent of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

               <p>But if we fall to eſteem vertue, goodneſs, power, and ſtrength in our prayers to do us the good, to be able to move God, and to prevail with God to do us the good; we make an Idol of our Praver, and we and our prayers ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>I know there are many in theſe modern times profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and having ſundry names for their different waies, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Arminians, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and others; and all zealous of the commandements of our God, and the duties thereof, eſpecially they of thoſe ſorts, which for the manifeſtation of their zeal, and increaſe of Proſelites,

make many private meetings and Conventicles, for prayer, and performances of other duties commanded to edification of men in their wayes, whereby they think, they pleaſe God, pacifie God, move God, and prevail with God to do them good: But alas in all theſe they rob Chriſt of his honour, and make an Idol of their Prayers and performances, for that they give the honour that is onely Chriſts, (to pleaſe God, to pacifie God, to move God, to prevail with God to do men good) unto their own performances, which in truth are corrupt and ſinful, and therefore cannot pleaſe God.</p>

3.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes that they have in all humbleneſs and reverence, for the care, zeal, and devotion of the duties of all godlineſs, is wrought up in them by the Spirit of Chriſt, which they, as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Vine Chriſt, abiding and alive in him, do bear and hold forth; and they are not ſo wrought up in them to bear and hold them forth, that they ſhould thereby pleaſe and pacifie God, or prevail with God to do them good; ut to manifeſt, evidence, and witneſs to them, that God is pleaſed with them, and pacified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in Chriſt, whoſe fruits they are that they bear and hold forth: And that Chriſts performances in himſelf have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and will ever prevail with God to do them good, that all ſhall work together for the beſt unto them, and herein is the joy and the reſt of true Believers.</p>
               <p>Indeed I hear there are ſome, becauſe they hear there is no goodneſs in their Prayers and duties performing to pleaſe God, no promiſe to prevail with God to do them goed, therefore they give over prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Thou ſhalt find it true, If thou doſt not deny thy ſelf to be good, to have goodneſs, (as here Chriſt commandeth) thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt an idol of thy ſelf; and if thou doſt hold thy prayer to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue or power to pleaſe God, to move God to do thee good, thou makeſt an idol of thy prayer, giving that honour to it, which is onely Chriſts, to whom all power is given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome will ask, if prayer move not and prevail not with God by the ſtrength it hath to the forgiveneſs of ſin, and to the healing diſeaſes in men, why doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If any man be ſick, among you, let him ſend for the Elders of the church, and let them pray for him</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, and of he have committed ſin, it ſhall be forgiven him;</hi> and further, <hi>The prayer of a Righteous man availeth much if it be fervent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpel is a miſtery, Faith is a miſtery, and Chriſt is a miſtery, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) which myſtery is hid to thoſe which are loſt, be they never ſo wiſe and learned otherwiſe: And in theſe words is this myſtery, as in many other of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that the Elders or the prayers of the Elders ſhall ſave the ſick, and raiſe them up, or procure forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, or avail much with God; but he ſaith, the prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick, the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, the ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſhall be forgiven him; it is the prayer of Faith that availeth, there is the myſtery.</p>
               <p>Now we are to obſerve, that both Prayer and Faith are fruits of the Spirit, and the fruits of the Spirit are wrought up into the branches from Chriſt the Vine, as the fruits of the vine are wrought up to the branches that bear them, by the ſpirits of the vine: The Repreſentation is Chriſt, where he ſaith, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fruits of the vine, wrought up by the ſpirits of the vine to the branches which bear them, are not to do any thing to, or for the branches, but to ſhew and manifeſt that thoſe branches that bear them are abiding alive in the vine, that they are living bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the vine, and thoſe branches have thoſe fruits, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to them from the vine by the ſpirits thereof, that they are all of the vine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:118157:14"/>
So then Faith and Prayer being fruits of the Vine Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, to the Elders of the church, the branches of Chriſt do not, nor can do any thing to them, or for them that bear them, but onely manifeſt, evidence, and witneſs to them that they are in Chriſt, that they have all good for them from Chriſt, his undertaking and performance, that they are all from Chriſt as his inſtruments; it is none of the Elders power, vertue, or godlineſs whereby the ſick is healed, ſaved, ſin is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid,) <hi>It is not of our power or godlineſs that this lame</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>man is healed:</hi> Neither muſt theſe ſay ſo, except they will make themſelves Gods; for there is none that can forgive ſinnes but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 7.</note> God onely, none heal and ſave but Chriſt onely; there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other, ſaith <hi>Luke.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is meant then that prayer doth onely manifeſt and witneſs the ſaving, healing, and forgiveneſs of ſin from Chriſt and his performances, not that Prayer, Faith, or any godlineſs of man doth it.</p>
               <p>The Brazen Serpent did ſhew and witneſſe their healing from Chriſt, repreſented by it, but it did not heal them by any vertue or ſtrength in it.</p>
               <p>The Image or ſtamp of <hi>Caeſars</hi> coyn made it go for payment, it was not the metal or matter it ſelf that made it payment: So it is the ſpirit of Chriſt in Prayer that makes it Prayer, and not mans prayer it ſelf.</p>

In that Chriſt holdeth forth this command to men that follow him, to deny themſelves, as alſo other commands (which he knoweth) no man can do before God, and man himſelf know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; as <hi>Adam</hi> knew himſelf naked, and made himſelf aprons of <note place="margin">

For that the holding forth of the Law and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth to Believers what Chriſt hath done for them in himſelf, in performing of the righteouſneſs thereof, and in their deliverance from the curſe and penalty thereof, to the full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God: And that the performances of Jeſus Chriſt in them by his Spirit, ſent unto them in the fruits thereof, borne and held forth of them, as branches of the Vine Jeſus Chriſt, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, evidence, and witneſs the ſame to their ſouls, fully done of Chriſt in himſelf for their juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe. Comfort, Thanks, and Love.</hi> From hence ariſeth the firſt unſpeakable comfort to Believers, to ſee the righteouſneſs of ſo good, juſt, and holy a Law and commandement performed for them, whereunto they were bound upon inevitable pain, and which they themſelves were not able to do in the leaſt; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have all the good and benefit thereof; and to ſee the curſes, dangers, miſeries, and penalties they are delivered and freed from, all cloſed in the commandement, and before them opened, and the ſame witneſſed and ſealed unto them by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the fruits there of wrought up in them.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man hath taken a great houſe to build, and is bound ſtraitly for the performance thereof, and is aſſuredly to have a thouſand pound if he build it, to be paid when it is finiſhed; But this man is by his failings grown ſo much indebted, that he is not able to do any thing of the building, his Creditors come ſo faſt upon him.</p>
               <p>If a friend ſhall build this houſe for him, and pay all his debts alſo, would not this be a great comfort to him? Yea, ſure he would think himſelf bound to be thankful to that friend, and to love him as long as he lives, otherwiſe he were an unworthy man.</p>
               <p>Every man is bound to perform this building, which is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the command of God, but his tranſgreſſion is ſo much, (which is his debt to pay) that he is not able to do any thing of the command.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt put forth himſelf a friend to all Believers in him, he builds the houſe for them, he hath paid all the debt of their tranſgreſſion, with the price of his paſſion, blood, and death,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118157:15"/>
and they have the whole benefit and the reward thereof.</p>
               <p>Is not this a comfort to every believer, will not this make them thankful, and ever to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Surely that man is no believer that ſheweth not comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yea their fulnes and love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for this.</p>

            <p>And I take it, the love and free grace of God in his Chriſt to the Elect, is the fulfiller and the fulfilling of the will of God, his Law, and commandement of all theſe, and the reſt for them; (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith) <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I take it, the love of the Elect to God, and all the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8.</note> of the Elect, never have been, are, or ſhall be any cauſe or motive of Gods love and free grace to them, or of any of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances thereof, or therein to them: As, neither of the gift of his Son Chriſt, nor of their election in Chriſt, their ſanctification and juſtification before him; their Predeſtination and Ordination to eternal life; their Adoption and Glorification; their Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Raiſing up in Chriſt; their love to God or man; their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and Faith; their Obedience, Repentance, Prayers, and Thankſgiving: Nor of the true Preaching, Teaching, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all or any of theſe to them.</p>
            <p>And although I finde not many that ſay, the love and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

of the Elect to God, was the cauſe of Gods love to them before the world, and of Gods performances for them, and to them, before the world.</p>

            <p>For (ſay they) God hath promiſed good to them that love God, and do the duties of love to God and men, as to ſhew mercy to thouſands in them that love him and keep his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; and ſaith, <hi>To them that fear my Name, the ſun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi>

               <hi>Iſrael overcame the Amalekites.</hi> Elijah <hi>prayed, and God ſent rain. God promiſeth to do good to them that love him, and perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of love, and hath ſhewed love, and requited much good to them which have performed the duties of love unto him:</hi> Therefore (ſay they) the Scriptures hold forth that the love of the Elect to God and their performance of the duties of love to God in this world, do cauſe, move, and incite God to love them and do them much good, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe ſeem to know the Scriptures in the hiſtory; But they know them not yet in the myſtery of God and Chriſt, and in the myſtery of faith and godlineſſe as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>I find the continual practiſe of Antichriſt is, by his inſtruments (alledging the hiſtory of the Scriptures) to advance the honour of man, and to abate the honour of God and his Chriſt. And this is the certain note and mark of this deceiving Spirit, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſſeth to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
            <p>This is a great advancement of mans honour, to teach, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 2. 4.</note> the Elect of God) he hath power to do that which ſhall cauſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118157:17"/>
move, and incite God to love him and do him good, and others; yea, and doth ſo by his believing, praying, and the reſt of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of his love and ſervice to God.</p>
            <p>Were it not a great honour to that poor ſubject, which for his fidelity, love, and performances to a great Potent and rich King, ſhould have the aſſurance of love, aſſiſtance, and good he would requeſt and deſire of the King, and that he by his performances to the King, could cauſe the King to do ſuch things for him when he would? Surely any man that were not envious, would praiſe and honour the happineſſe of this ſubject.</p>
            <p>So they which teach that the love of men to God, by their love, do cauſe and make God to love them; and by their Faith, do cauſe God to juſtifie them; and by their asking and praying, do cauſe, move, and incite God to grant and give them that they deſire, and by their repentance do cauſe God to forgive them; and by their other performances to God, do cauſe God to do them good; do much advance and honour men and their performances.</p>

            <p>The promiſe was not to the Elect as they are the corrupt man in themſelves, but to Chriſt, and to them onely as they are elected in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It was and is Chriſt onely that is able to perform the condition, and not man corrupted; whereas it is ſaid, the promiſes were ſuch made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Apoſtle meaneth, they were repeated, and clearly manifeſted to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which we made before to Chriſt, who was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> although of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation according to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>If the promiſe had been made to corrupt man as <hi>Abrahams</hi> alſo was, it had been in vain; for there was never any man that was able to have performed the condition, nor hath done, but in Chriſt which performed it for him.</p>

            <p>And as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The promiſe of the new Covenant of</hi>

               <hi>grace, called the new commandement, and condition, was made to the ſeed, (ſpeaking of one) which is Chriſt,</hi> onely able to do the will of God in the ſame commandement and covenant, being the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker to do the will of God of free grace, and freely ſaying, <hi>Lo</hi> I <hi>come to do thy will O God,</hi> for poor corrupt man which thou haſt elected in me, not able to do any thing thereof in himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the hiſtory of Scriptures, the promiſe be often found helf forth to man, becauſe Chriſt of grace imputeth, and freely giveth the good and benefit of the promiſe purchaſed by himſelf to his Elect; but afterwards reſerving the Praiſe, Honour, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof to himſelf.</p>
            <p>So the whole covenant of grace was made of God, with his Chriſt the undertaker, to do the will of God for poor corrupt man elected in Chriſt, as well the performing of the conditions and commandement therein, as receiving of the promiſe; although in the hiſtory of the Scriptures, the commandement and performances of the condition of the covenant be held forth to pertain to unable corrupt man, which onely pertaineth unto Chriſt, the gracious and able undertaker; for what is, doth, or hath poor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt man herein, but in Chriſt; Chriſts command to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is as he is God the commander in juſtice, to the Elect, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker of the work before God in grace.</p>
            <p>Indeed our God commandeth in the hiſtory of the Scriptures, both Reprobate and Elect, and his command is holy, juſt, and of authority; the Elect of themſelves, are ſtill corrupt in themſelves, although holy in Chriſt, in whom they are elected, and not able through their corruption to do the juſt command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:118157:19"/>
Chriſt that of authority commandeth, hath undertaken to do the will of God, as he ſaith, <hi>Lo</hi> I <hi>come to do thy will O God:</hi> And no <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9.</note> doubt but it was for the Elect, that Chriſt did undertake to do the will of God, as the payment of the debt in his juſtice for their tranſgreſſion, unto mercy and forgiveneſſe, their holineſſe and righteouſneſs before God.</p>
            <p>This will of God for payment to mercy and forgiveneſs, for righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and goodneſſe to them, which Chriſt undertook to do for the Elect, which themſelves were not, nor are able to do in the leaſt, no doubt he did, doth, and ever will do; graciouſly making them his inſtruments (as he pleaſeth,) and imputing all to them; upon which account it is ſaid, Chriſt is the Prieſt and the Sacrifice, the Law or Covenant-giver, and the Law or Covenant-keeper, the Judge and the Advocate, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and the doer of the commandement; as the renowned Father in the church of Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Do, Lord, that which thou commandeſt, and command what thou wilt.</hi>

            <p>Can it be thought that the juſt God will exact payment for that which he hath had full payment already, for which he had in his acceptance by Chriſts undertaking, ſo ſoon as Chriſt had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>If now there are many that hold ſo th the hiſtory of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to affirm and prove the temporal afflictions of the Elect, to be ordered unto them for their ſins againſt God and men, for their ſins before God and before men.</p>
            <p>But the myſtery of our God and Chriſt, of faith, and godlineſs doth hold forth, that afflictions are not ordered of Chriſt to the Elect for their ſins either againſt God or men, as the payment of the debt thereof, or as in revenge of wrath, which are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

A loving father will not chaſtiſe his child for the offence done, if he knoweth that he will offend no more, but will paſſe by the fault; and if he doth chaſtiſe him, it is that he might not offend afterward, to keep him from offending: And <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed all that they do to cauſe, move, and incite God to love them and do them good is in vain; for it is Chriſt only that doth and can do that, the doing of the elect cannot do it, which is ſinfull and corrupt.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe Chriſt the undertaker for the elect, which hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command, commandeth in the government of his Church to love, pray, praiſe, give, forgive, and the reſt. The elect do the ſame not in vain, but of duty, becauſe Chriſt their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker hath commanded, although they do not, nor can do the ſame, according to the holy command. A Scholler which is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his favourable Schoolmaſter to write his copie given him, and which he knoweth can write never a letter right, yet ought to write the ſame, becauſe he is commanded, but it were folly in the Scholler to look to be praiſed of his Maſter for his bad writing. And if any man ſhall ask why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hriſt commandeth the elect, which he knoweth can do nothing of the command, the anſwer may be; Firſt, for his good pleaſure and will and their humiliation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>iſt would have his people exerciſed, and not idle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though weak. Thirdly, becauſe although the goodneſſe of their doing the holy command is nothing, or extendeth not unto God, is no goodneſſe before God; yet before men, in mens eſtimation it is goodneſſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My goodneſse extendeth not to thee O Lord, but to the Saints which are upon the earth:</hi> It is good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <note place="margin">

and another, and edification of one another. Fifthly, for their knowledge of their tranſgreſſions, of omiſſion and commiſſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, I <hi>had not known ſin but by the law.</hi> If Chriſt had not a commandement to bid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd forbid, the elect had not known <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7.</note> their ſins and tranſgreſſions. The Scholler which writeth never a letter well of his copie, knoweth by his copie (if he regard it and perule it well his fault in every word and letter, although he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mend it. So by the holy and righteous command of Chriſt, the Elect may ſee and know their errour if they mind it, and look upon it well, although they cannot amend their errour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Sixtly, Chriſt commandeth them to do, although he know they can do nothing of the holy command before God, becauſe he would have them know and conſider of his grace and goodneſs to them, in undertaking and performing thoſe things of the holy commandement for them firſt and laſt, unto their ſalvation and everlaſting happineſs, which themſelves were not able to do in the leaſt, and to take up the ſong of <hi>David</hi> the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, continually before men, praiſing the Lord for his goodneſs, and to declare the wonders that he hath done for the children of men, ſo that their labour is not in vain in the Lord. Seventhly, Becauſe when it pleaſeth the L. Jeſus Chriſt to ſend his holy ſpirit to them, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 1. 5. 8.</note> to act in them theſe things of his holy commandement, and to make them his branches to bear and bring forth ſuch fruits in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe of heart, in ſincerity and godlineſſe, as fruits of the ſpirit in truth; then theſe are true evidences, teſtimonies, and witneſſes of the ſpirit received, as the Tree is known by the fruits (in the rule of Chriſt.) And the ſpirit received, doth witneſſe that they are the children of God; <hi>We have received the ſpirit</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,) <hi>and the ſame ſpirit doth witneſs, that we are the children of</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Further, the deceiving ſpirit objecteth, to teach that mans love to God, his prayer, praiſe, his giving, forgiving, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and the reſt like commanded, do not cauſe, move, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite God to love, give, and forgive his ſervants, and do them good; is the flaking and quenching of all devotion and religious ſervice to God.</p>

man by his love, believing, praying, praiſing, giving, forgiving, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and the reſt, can procure God to love, juſtifie, give, and forgive, which is onely the work that Chriſt hath undertaken for poor unable man, ſaying, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God;</hi> which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

            <p>But in thoſe which are true believers, their doctrine doth not quench, but kindle devotion, and religious worſhip, and ſervice to God and his Chriſt: For can there be greater incitement to devotion and Religion, then for a man to be taught of God, and to be aſſured by the ſpirit of Chriſt in him; that Chriſt hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do all for him, to his juſtification and ſalvation before God; that Chriſt (with the will and good pleaſure of God) hath done, doth, and will do all for him to God, paid his debt, made his peace, and made his reconciliation with God for his ſins, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the imputation of his righteouſneſs to him, in and by his fulfilling of the holy Law of God for him, making him to be holy and without blame before God in love, cauſing, moving, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing God to love him, give to him, forgive him, and do him all good; when as himſelf, in himſelf, is ſtill a ſinner, corrupt, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and hath no good thing in him, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, he had not <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, although all times, things, and acts were preſent with God before the world, yet they were not alike preſent; God ſeeth things as they are, difference of time, and circumſtance adhering, he ſeeth election before time, juſtification in time, and remiſſion of ſin after it is commited: He ſeeth not theſe <hi>ab aeterno.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that thoſe which God knew before the world, he would afterward predeſtinate, he would afterward

call, afterward juſtifie, afterward glorifie. But he ſaith, thoſe which he knew before the world, he predeſtinated, called, juſtified, and glorified them, before himſelf unchangable, although theſe do not appear, and are manifeſted to the creature, till fulneſſe of time.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Antipoſition is, <hi>That man not having the Spirit, may and can do Morall works, yea good Morall works before God: and that man having the Spirit, can do Morall good works much more, yea and ſpirituall alſo, by the inſtrumentall aſſistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take it the Scribes and Phariſees did Morall good works before men, as fair in mans ſight as any other, then, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence, but I do not find them ſaid, to be as good and righteous be or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God.</p>
            <p>And I take it, if the Spirit be only an inſtrumentall aſſiſtance to them which have the Spirit, ſo Chriſt is at the will and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, as the inſtrument is at the diſpoſition of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and to be procured by mans art and power to be his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall aſſiſtant; a great diſhonor to Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> called himſelf <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1.</note> a ſervant and inſtrument of Jeſus Chriſt, but he never called Chriſt his inſtrument or ſervant.</p>
            <p>The third Antipoſition is, <hi>That man having the Spirit, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſanctification and holineſſe in himſelf, and may bring forth, and do the works of holineſſe</hi> (as the Agent thereof) <hi>righteous in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Poſition (they ſay) the words of Chriſt uphold, which ſay, <hi>Except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phraiſees ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This exceeding righteouſneſſe to be had, to enter into the Kingdome (ſay they) is the inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which they have, which have the Spirit, by the ſanctification of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I take it, the exceeding righteouſneſſe to be had of thoſe which enter into the Kingdome of heaven, ſpoken of by Chriſt, is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by imputation to his Elect, Believers, not the inherent ſuppoſed righteouſneſſe in themſelves, which they have by the ſanctification of the Spirit, whereby, they ſay, they are inabled to do the works of holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the Agent thereof before God.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtle ſaith, alledging <hi>David</hi> for a witneſſe, That man is the bleſſed man, that is to enter into the Kingdom of heaven, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>And that further, to uphold inherent righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in man, by the ſanctification of the Spirit, do further alledge the Apoſtle, which ſaith to the believing Corinthians, <hi>neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous men, nor fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, wantons, bugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, thieves, covetous, drunkards, railers, nor extortioners, ſhall enter</hi>

               <hi>into the Kingdome of heaven, and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, ye are ſanctified, ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> He ſaith, they were now waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I take it, this doth not prove (although theſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corinthians) were waſhed now, ſanctified and juſtified now in their own knowledge and light in the name of Jeſus, and in the Spirit of our God, when God gave the light to them, that they were not waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified before this, in the ſight of God, by Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from the beginning. Nor doth it prove, that they had now inherent holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in themſelves, to do the works of holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe before God at that time.</p>
            <p>I take it, Believers have ſtill inherent corruption and ſin in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which corruption is in every part and parcell of ſoul and body, as the Apoſtle of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A little leaven, leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6</note>
            </p>
            <p>If they had inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in themſelves in every part of ſoul and body, the ſame would expell them from corruption, and ſo there ſhould be no corruption and ſin in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for two contraries are not in one ſubject together at the ſame time, if it be light, it is not dark, if it be cold, there is not heat, inherent. When a ſtronger then the ſtrong man cometh (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he taketh away the ſtrong mans armor, diſpoſſeſſeth him, and divideth the ſpoils,</hi> Luke 11. 21, 22. But of the operation of the Spirit in Believers, and of the mortification and ſanctification of the Spirit, it is ſaid more afterward. We find it recorded in Scripture, that <hi>Moſes, Lot, Reuben,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarches, <hi>Iob, Moſes, Aaron, David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. after they had the Spirit, had corruption, which brought forth ſin mentioned: and no doubt, but other ſin not mentioned in them.</p>
            <p>And I take it, Doctrine of inherent holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in man, by the ſanctification of the Spirit, is of Antichriſt, and to make men proud Phariſees, to truſt in themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118157:23"/>
others, to make them think they are not as other men are, nor as this or that ſinner.</p>
            <p>But I know the Doctrine of Chriſts Spirit is to make men hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Publicans, to ſmite their breaſts, ſaying, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> and wholly to deny themſelves.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) is confuted by the Prophets, by Chriſt himſelf, and by his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> (ſpeaking of himſelf and others, having the Spirit) ſaith, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, all our righteouſneſs is as filthy rags;</hi> and after <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>there is nonerighteous that doth good, no not one.</hi> Chriſt ſaith to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Thou hypocrite,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom</hi> 3 10.</note> 
               <hi>why ſeest thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, and ſeest not the beam that is in thine own eye? &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>judge not, that ye be not judged, and when ye have done what ye can, ſay we are unprofitable ſervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, after he had the Spirit known to himſelf, <hi>In me,</hi> that is <hi>in my fleſh, the corrupt man, dwelleth no good things, I find no means to perform that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where was <hi>Pauls</hi> inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when there dwelt no good thing in him, and when he found no means to perform that which was good in himſelf, where was his inablement in himſelfe by the inſtrumentall aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to do the works of holineſſe and righteouſneſs in the ſight of God?</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> meant (by performance to do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) and that he might do that which was good and righteous in the ſight of God, although he did not the ſame perfectly, it is but a ſophiſticall cavill, <hi>For there is nothing good and righteous in the ſight of God, which is not perfectly good and righteous;</hi> his Sacrifice is <note place="margin">

            <p>Certainly theſe Poſitions are from the root of Antichriſt, and there is no eſſentiall point of Popery, as I may have ground and ſuſtentation from them, as mans holy and righteous works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>

            <p>INherent holineſs and righteouſneſs, in part remaining in men after the generall fall and loſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby they had ſtill free-will and power to do the commandement unto their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Was the hereſie of the Palagians confuted and exploded, in the Primitive times after the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But ſoon after, the Papiſts loath to humble themſelves to their corrupt condition, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, loath to deny themſelves, becauſe they would not come manifeſtly in the pride of man, with the Palagians, and in their confuted errour.</p>
            <p>Therefore acted by the ſpirit of Antichriſt, they invented ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, whereby, they ſay, man hath inherent holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in himſelf, by the ſanctification of the Spirit, and hereby they are inabled to do the works of holineſs and righteouſneſs themſelves, pleaſing to God, accepted with God, moving, and cauſing God to do them good.</p>
            <p>This is the ground of all their proud Popiſh Tenents.</p>
            <p>And from this ground the Arminians, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Presbyterians, and other, hold forth many things to the exalting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118157:26"/>
of man, and the pulling down of Chriſt, to the great diſhonor of Jeſus Chriſts undertakings and performances, for poor, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, unable dead man in himſelf, of free grace choſen of God in Chriſt, and given to him of God, to undertake and perform all for unto life; which they do, when they teach and ſay, that they, by their Inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe have power and free-will to do, and can do themſelves the works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch as pleaſe God, are accepted with God, and do move and cauſe God to do them good, which all are the works of Chriſt, and no part thereof mans, but by account and grace of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore the ſame and the reſt of that ſort, are no better then robbery, ſacriledge, and idolatry.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which hold forth Inherent holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in man, do boaſt themſelves to be in a better eſtate and condition for life, then <hi>Adam</hi> was ever in; to have more power then <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency unto holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and the work of the holy and righteous commandement of God for life, (which ſaith, <hi>do this and live)</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> ever had: for <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency had no power to repent, if he fail'd that he might live by repentance, if he failed of life by obedience and words; nor had <hi>Adam</hi> power to pray for mercy and forgiveneſſe, to move God by repentance and prayer, and to obtain the ſame of God by prayer. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had had this, there had been no need of the proviſion of a Chriſt for falne man; for <hi>Adams</hi> repentance and prayer for mercy and forgiveneſſe, had been enough to have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God for forgiveneſs of the tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>But (they ſay) they have not only power and free-will to doe the righteouſneſs of the command, through their inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs, but alſo ſuch a ſanctified will, that their will cannot fail or hinder their power, as <hi>Adams</hi> did, to do the work.</p>
            <p>They have power to repent and convert themſelves unto life, if they fail in the righteous work; and power to pray, and ſo to prevail with God by their prayer, that they ſhall obtain mercy and forgiveneſs of all, by vertue of their inherent holineſs and righteouſneſs in themſelves. Oh ſure they muſt needs be as proud of this inherent holineſs and righteouſneſs in themſelves, by the ſantification of the Spirit; and be as thankfull to God alſo, that they are not as other men are, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> was for his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that he had in himſelf of the Spirit of God in his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118157:27"/>
for which he thanked God that he was not as other men <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11.</note> were, unrighteous &amp; ſinners. And herein the late upholder of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holineſs and righteouſneſs in man, by the ſanctification of the Spirit, go beyond the Papiſts (which were the founders thereof) in exalting that Idol. For the Papiſts wil not allow every man that hath the ſame, to be inabled thereby to convert himſelf, if he have failed in the work of holineſs and righteouſneſs, and to ſatisfie with the repentance of his own frame, but he muſt be ordered and injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed penance by the Pope, or other his Subſtitutes, Confeſſors, to men offending, which muſt be obeyed, and all performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by the Delinquents, for abſolution and recovery of life and ſafety to themſelves.</p>
            <p>And they muſt not pray as they will themſelves, to move God to mercy and forgiveneſs, and to beſtow good things upon them, but they muſt be ordered and appointed of thoſe Agents and Confeſſors, how many <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> they muſt ſay for the ſame, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But theſe conclude, that by his own power, that every man hath of his inherent holineſs and righteouſneſs, he is not only ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do the work of holineſs and righteouſneſs acceptable to God, but alſo (if he fail) to convert himſelf to repent at will, to move God to mercy and forgiveneſs, and to do him needful good when he will intentionally and devoutly pray for the ſame.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe (for manifeſtation of the premiſes to be ſo, as is ſaid) the upholders of inherent holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in man, teach and exhort all men to do the works of holineſs and righteouſneſs commanded upon eternall gain and pain, and to repent of their fallings, that they may not periſh but live thereby, to pray intentionally in publike and private, to do duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and to do all theſe to pleaſe God, to pacifie God, to move God to do them good by theſe their performances, without any doubt of going well with them (ſo doing) as if all men aſſembled, had this their ſuppoſed holineſs and righteouſneſs, and thereby power in themſelves to do the works of holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to repent, pray, and prevail with God to obtain all good at Gods hand thereby, and divert the wrath and judgements from them, as if they had God in a bond.</p>
            <p>When as the Prophets of God, and the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt themſelves, do acknowledge, that they had no ſuch inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs in themſelves, by the ſanctification of the

Spirit, whereby they were inabled to do the works of holineſs and righteouſneſs before God; and do acknowledge, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did no ſuch works of holineſs and righteouſneſs before God, nor had any ſuch power in themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, God looked down from heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and ſeek God; but (ſaith he) <hi>they were all gone out of the</hi>

            <p>And again the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If it be of grace,</hi> (meaning that <note place="margin">

which all in the Scriptures are held forth to reſemble Chriſt and the holy Spirit, in their operations upon the bodies neere, and object to them; which foure creatures are the Sun, Fire, Water, and ſweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>
            <p>The Sun of this world is held forth in the Scripture to reſemble the Son of righteouſneſſe Jeſus Chriſt, in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and actions to Believers, <hi>Unto you that feare my</hi>

               <hi>name, the Sonne of righteouſneſſe ſhall ariſe, and health ſhall be under his wings:</hi> He, ſaith the Prophecy, alluding to the riſing of the Sun of the world upon the earth and the body therein, in mens appearance and apprehenſion, to the comfort and refreſhing of them; for being as the Sun of the world to Jeſus Chriſt, ariſeth and manifeſteth himſelfe to Believers, when and as he pleaſeth, in their apprehenſions, to the comfort and refreſhing of the whole man.</p>
            <p>And as the Sun of the world ariſing, doth heat the colds object bodies, ſo that the heat thereof heateth the cold bodies neere them by reflection, yea and melteth ſome hard bodies by the heat thereof; and yet the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall coldneſſe of thoſe bodies, and the hardneſſe, remaine ſtill in them naturally, as appear in the ſtay of the heat to thoſe bodies.</p>

            <p>And ſo the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaid, God is a Sun and a ſhield, alluding to Jeſus Chriſt, which is the only ſhield <note place="margin">

            <p>And ſo is Jeſus Chriſt, and his Spirit in Believers, in the Scripture, reſembled to the fire of this world, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the operation thereof upon the bodies neere. <hi>The Lord wil be as a wall of fire about Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: A wall of fire will defend and keep ſafe any City from hurt of adverſary and enemies. So Jeſus Chriſt is a wall of fire to ſave his Elect Believers from the divell, hell, ſinne, the law, and death, that they ſhall not hurt them. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt them,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18</note> ſaith Chriſt; that they may ſay with <hi>Paul, O death where is thy ſting? O grave (or hell) where is thy victory? The ſting</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56, 57.</note> 
               <hi>of death is ſinne, the strength of ſinne is the Law: But thanks be unto God, that hath given us victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> which hath beene a wall of fire unto us from theſe our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</p>
            <p>And further, Jeſus Chriſt and his holy Spirit in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is in the Scriptures reſembled to fire in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thereof; becauſe as fire melteth, purifieth things, ſo Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit, and the word of his Spirit melteth the hearts of the Believers, as <hi>Ioſias</hi> heart melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the hearing of Gods word, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 19. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo purifieth their corrupt hearts, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, God gave the Holy Ghoſt to the Gentiles, which purified their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118157:30"/>
hearts by faith or believing. And for this it is ſaid, Chriſt will <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9</note> baptize with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire; and Gods word is as fire, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 29.</p>
            <p>Yet it is to be obſerved, that although gold or other metall be melted by the fire, the hardneſſe thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth and remaineth naturally in and to the ſame (as is ſeen) in the ſtay of the heat of the fire. So though Chriſt by his Spirit and ſpiritual word, melteth the corrupt hard heart of believers, yet the corrupt hardneſſe remaineth ſtill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and returneth in the ſtay of the operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>And as although the fire purifieth the gold, yet the gold muſt be after melted and purified by the ſire, as the Prophet ſaith, ſeven times, that is oftentimes before it be pure gold, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12. 6.</note> and is not pure gold, ſo long as any droſſe remains in it, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part thereof, but ſtill droſſie gold. So although Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit often melteth and purifieth the corrupt heart of believers, yet ſo long as corruption remaineth (which remaining) remaineth in every part of ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that no part is pure and holy before God in man himſelf, whatſoever it be in mans eſtimation, but ſtill corrupt in the whole, and ſo ſhall be, till corruptible hath put on incorruption, and mortall hath put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>And Jeſus Chriſt and his Spirit in Believers, are in the Scriptures reſembled to water for the operations thereof, as waſhing, cleanſing, ſlaking, quenching and refreſhing. So Chriſt reſembled himſelf to the water of the Well, unto the woman, <hi>If thou hadſt asked of me, I would have given</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>thee of the water of life,</hi> meaning himſelfe, and his holy Spirit. And againe, <hi>Take of the water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17</note>
            </p>
            <p>For as water waſheth and cleanſeth foul bodies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth weary bodies, and ſoftneth dry and hard bodies, as Clay, and the like; and quencheth and ſlaketh exceſſive heat in earthy bodies, ſo Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit hath all theſe operations upon Believers in the corrupted man. The Apoſtle writeth of the believing Corinthians, which had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118157:31"/>
been great ſinners, that now they were waſhed, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and juſtified in the name of Jeſus Chriſt by the Spirit of our God, in manifeſtation to themſelves. Chriſt telleth ſome of his Diſciples that had heard him preach the Word, <hi>Now you are clean through the word that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you. Job</hi> ſaid the Lord had ſoftned his heart; God <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 23. 16</note> ſaith, he will take the ſtony heart away from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and give them a heart of fleſh, a ſoft heart; <hi>David</hi> ſaid, that his Shepheard the living Lord would lead him into green paſtures and waters of comfort, refreſhing waters. <hi>The Spirit mortifieth the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The faith of Jeſus Chriſt quencheth the fiery darts of the wicked, ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>And yet as although water waſheth and cleanſeth foule bodies, ſoftneth hard, refreſheth faint and weary, quencheth and ſlaketh heat. If this foulneſſe, hardneſſe, faintneſſe and heat be naturall to thoſe bodies, the ſame will return and remaine to them in the ſtay of the operation of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>So although Jeſus Chriſt by his ſpirit waſheth and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the foulneſſe, ſoftneth the hardneſſe, refreſheth the faintneſſe, mortifieth, quencheth, and ſlaketh the heat of corruption in the corrupt man; yet becauſe corruption is inherent in believers, and naturall, all will remain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, till that which is corruptible hath put on incorruption, and mortall hath put on immorrality.</p>
            <p>And to goe through the reſemblances of Chriſt by his Spirit to believers, as is in the Scripture; So Chriſt and his Spirit are reſembled to ſweet odours. The Apoſtle calleth Chriſt the ſweet odour to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. And the Spouſe in the Canticles reſembleth Chriſt to myrrhe, ſpices, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. 14. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 5. 13.</note> ſweet flowers, ſaying, his fruit is ſweet, his voice is ſweet, and his lips and mouth moſt ſweet; and as earthly ſweet odours ſweeten things neer them, to the ſweeting of other things neer them, ſo Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit ſweetneth the corrupt ſoul and body where it dwelleth in believers, even to the ſweetning of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118157:31"/>
Yet as notwithſtanding the ſweeting of odours to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lythings which are naturally ill-ſavoured, their ill-ſavour will return and remain in the ſtay of the ſweet odours to them. So in the ſtay of their ſweeting of Jeſus Chriſt and his Spirit to the corrupt man, naturally corrupted, unſavoury corruption returneth and remaineth, till the corruptible hath put on incorruption, and the mortall hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: and this was that which made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And the ſame made the Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>Careles</hi> to ſing that mournfull ſong,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Indeed ſometimes I do repent, to God for mercy call,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But yet alas incontinent to ſin again I fall.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee much operation of the Spirit of Chriſt in Believers upon the corrupted man, ſoul and body; that there is much mortification of ſin and corruption, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to the corrupt man in ſoul and body by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Although ſanctification and holineſſe be not inherent in the corrupt man, as corruption and ſin is inherent in every part of ſoul and body; for ſo (two contraries being in one ſubject together at the ſame time, the one would utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the other) and there would be nothing but holineſſe, no ſin and corruption in Believers (which is apparent to be) and the Apoſtle ſaith there is, yet there is ſanctification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Believers by the Spirit, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt maketh or worketh in us, in our ſouls or bodies, inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification and redemption, but Chriſt Jeſus is made unto us wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

For then God would not have Elected ſome in his Chriſt, out of the generall Company of the Children of wrath, to be adopted his Children through Chriſt, to be Holy and without blame before God in love: And have left forſaken, and reprobated the reſt, ſtill to be the Children of his hatred and wrath, if God had intended the gift of his Sonne, to undertake to ſhed his Blood, to Ranſome, Redeeme, and be a Reconciliation to him, for the Reprobate, for all, one and other.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Scripture hold forth, that the Chriſt of God did undertake to dye and ſhed his moſt pretious Blood, Ranſome, Redeeme and was a Reconciliation to God, for the ſins of any of the left Children of Gods hatred and wrath; but onely of thoſe which were Elected in Chriſt, <hi>before the Foundation of the World, to be Holy without blame with God in love,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he and <note place="margin">Eph. 1 4.</note> all the Elect of God in Chriſt were.

            <p>Sure no man will give his beloved Sonne to death, or pay ten thouſand pound of money for to gaine that to him, which he refuſeth to have, or which he knew will not be gained.</p>
            <p>And it had been a preſumptuous diſobedience in Chriſt, to his Father; and prodigality in Chriſt, of his precious Blood, to have ſhed it for a Ranſome and Redemption of thoſe, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not Elected in him, and given him to Ranſome and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme, and which he knew his Father hated to be Elected and Redeemed.

            <p>Who is it, that knew the Scriptures, that will not acknowledge that mankinde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that God of love, free grace and mercy, was pleaſed to Elect ſome of thoſe in Chriſt, which were the Children of wrath (as well as the other) out of whole <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> company of the Children of wrath, to be adopted the Children of God through Jeſus Chriſt (that is) by his performing the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law of workes for them, and by giving of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto death for them, and ſhedding of his precious bloud for them, for a full ſatisfaction to God in his juſtice, for the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Redemption, Juſtification, eternall life and glorification. And this for them onely, and not for the leaſt ones in their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and refuſed ones of God?</p>
            <p>Surely to ſay &amp; hold forth that Chriſt gave himſelf for a Ranſom of theſe, to ſhed his blood, to redeeme theſe, is to lay upon God and his Chriſt inconſtancy, indiſcretion, prodigality and folly, to the great diſhonour of God, and his Chriſt, and to ſay that Chriſt did Ranſome, and Redeeme them with his death and bloud is unrighteouſneſſe and ſalſehood.</p>
            <p>We finde and read in the Scripture, that Chriſt redeemed the Elected of God in Chriſt (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe and all other Elected of Chriſt) God hath Elected us in Chriſt before the <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:118157:37"/>
world, and <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe.</hi> But we finde no <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> where in the Scripture to be ſaid expreſly, that Chriſt redeemed reprobate ones, which were not Elected in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The greateſt power of their aſſertion, is in the word (all,) or (all men,) which word they ſtretch forth to Elect and Reprobate good and bad (as we ſay.) But it is cleare that where this word (all) in ſuch manner and matter, importeth onely all the Elect. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, As by the offence of one, the fault came on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note>

            <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> (meaning as all mankinde being then in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Adam,</hi> when he tranſgreſſed and dyed, then dyed) ſo all (being Elected in Chriſt) ſhall be made alive.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe will not ſay that all men Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in generall ſhall be made alive in Chriſt, then none muſt be damned; and if theſe will have theſe to be confined in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to that, why may not they admit of thoſe alſo, to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confined to the Elect, they being in the like expreſſe of the ſame matter.</p>
            <p>But they ſay by Preaching, that Chriſt hath given himſelfe for all men in generall, Elect and Reprobate, that he hath ſhed his blood for the peace of all men, with God they procure great honour, and the hardeſt harted men will be moved to relent, when they heare that Chriſt hath had ſuch pitty and mercy on them, as to give himſelfe to death for their life, to ſhed his moſt pretious blood to make their peace with God. This will move the worſt of men to imbrace Chriſt, to thirſt after Chriſt, and to beleeve and cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet I wiſh theſe to conſider that the Apoſtle of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>We may not doe evill that good may come thereof, whoſe damnation is juſt.</hi> We may not preach falſehood that Chriſt may have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> thereby. This was the great ſinne of <hi>Saul,</hi> that brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him his woefull deſtruction. He ſpared the beſt and fatteſt Beaſts of <hi>Amilech,</hi> contrary to the command of God, to offer up in Sacrifice to the honour of God, but <hi>Samuel</hi> told him, <hi>he had done wickedly, to obey was better then Sacrifice.</hi>

It is to be well obſerved which the Apoſtle ſaith; That, in that excellent Sermon which <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Antioch As many as</hi>

Certainly (by the part of the Apoſtles words) it was becauſe they were not ordeined to eternall life, <hi>they were not elected in Chriſt before the world, to be holy and without blame</hi>

of univerſall redemption (which is a falſe Goſpel) will make reprobates to relent, to embrace Chriſt, to thirſt after Chriſt, to believe, and cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, is a withholding of the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, and a covering of the truth with falſhood.</p>
            <p>I know theſe (to beare out their errour) alleadge many other arguments then are before mentioned (as the Commiſſion of Chriſt to the eleven Apoſtles) <hi>Goe ye into all the world, and</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now (ſay they) wherefore, and to what end, did Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to preach the Goſpel of ſalvation to every creature in the whole world (without exception) if he knew before, that there were many that would not, nor could believe the Goſpel of ſalvation preached unto them? This Commiſſion was in vaine, and their preaching in vaine to every creature, yet to them which would not, nor could believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The principall end of Chriſts Commiſſion was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Chriſt and his performances, the love, free-grace of God and ſalvation thereby, to the which were ordeined <note place="margin">See Eph. 4. 11, 12. 13.</note> to eternall life, and to believe the Goſpel thereof preached: For (the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>the Gospel is hid to thoſe which are loſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3.</note> (that is reprobate) although it be never ſo publickly preached to them. But the reaſon why Chriſt commanded the Goſpel to be preached to every creature, was becauſe the preaching (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a publique office) the Preacher a publique perſon, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Congregations, where the Reprobate is not diſcerned of man. The Preacher muſt of neceſſity preach the Goſpel for the outward hearing thereof, to every creature in every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where he preacheth. And yet there is no manifeſtation thereof to the Soule of the reprobate, for they bear about with them their judgement: <hi>Hearing they heare not, neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>

            <p>No ſinner can ſave it ſelf from death, it is Chriſt that ſaveth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaketh of Gods will concerning the death everlaſting of the firſt man, and the condition of the contract, and of all men in him, when God with him ſuſpended his owne will to their ſinne, and death which he knew the ſinne would bring on them, if they did ſinne, in the giving to them power and freewill then to ſtand or fall. So thats mans fall which was not by Gods will but his own.</p>
            <p>Gods choſen people are delivered from everlaſting death in him by Chriſt, in whom they are choſen, they cannot dye eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>And yet againe they argue, that God our Saviour <hi>will that all men ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> (as the <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> Apoſtle ſaith) Therefore (ſay they) although all did fall by <hi>Adam,</hi> yet Chriſt would have all men recorded and ſaved by him, by his death and performance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt would have all men elected in him, and ordeined to God in eternall life to be ſaved by him, <hi>and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth thereof by the preaching of the Gospel</hi> thereof, (which is the Apoſtles meaning) Not that Chriſt <hi>(which came to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 9.</note> 
               <hi>doe his Fathers will)</hi> did deſire, that thoſe (which his Father had reprobated and was not pleaſed to elect in him) and give him to ſave, as his ordeined to ſalvation ſhould be ſaved by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall performance; but according to his Fathers will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he, as his Father did, ſo he doth, leave them ſtill in their own hardneſſe.</p>

            <p>So I take it great preſumption, injury and high treaſon to our God, Chriſt and King, to Coyne and hold forth the pretious bloud of Chriſt, for more or leſſe then our God, Chriſt and King hath Coyned it for, which hath the teſtimony of holy ſcriptures. To have the Image and Superſcription of Chriſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118157:39"/>
for the redemption of thoſe which God elected in Chriſt, given, him to redeeme, ordeined to eternall life, before the world. And (as it pleaſeth the Lord Chriſt) to have the evidence and manifeſtation of the ſame, and the reſt of the graces of God in Chriſt to themſelves in believing.</p>
            <p>But have no teſtimony of ſcriptures for the redemption of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, or any way to be ſufficient for more then our God or King coyned it for.</p>
            <p>Indeed if our God and King had coyned it, to be payment for more to him then the elect in Chriſt, his bloud and death had been ſufficient for all them, but we in all humbleneſſe ought to ſubmit to Gods pleaſure and appointment. And I take it all the moſt fertile grounds of holy ſcripture will not beare and bring forth that unſavoury fruit to God and his Chriſt, of univerſall redemption.</p>
            <p>Read more for ſatisfaction hereof, in the one and twentieth page, of the ſecond Catechiſticall dialogue, uſefull for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, to the end of that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>And I adde, becauſe of ſatisfaction this one Argument, (further off thoſe that would maintaine their errour of Univerſall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption) ſaying, that the words of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>(God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the world,</hi> &amp;c.) Doe not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that God did chooſe <hi>Paul,</hi> or any particular perſon in Chriſt, <note place="margin">Eph 1. 4.</note> before the world, but the word Us, doe import that God made onely a generall choiſe in Chriſt, as of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, with thoſe beleeving <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to whom he wrote his Epiſtle to the reſt of beleevers, in a generall notion, not in a particular notion of every one. Which argumentation (although it may trouble the truth) yet it maketh nothing for Univerſall Redemption: For if God did chooſe ſome in Chriſt before the world to be Redeemed by Chriſts performance, it could not be all that Chriſt Redeemed by his Fathers appointment, thoſe that the Father did not chooſe in him, he did not Redeeme: therefore not all men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and not choſen.</p>
            <p>But if theſe men had not forgotten the Grammer rules, they woould not have miſconſtrued the Scripture; for the Grammer rule tels them, The firſt perſon whether Singular or Plurall, ſpeaketh of himſelfe, yea the firſt perſon plurall (although it ſpeaketh of himſelfe, and others) yet it ſpeaketh of himſelfe in particular, with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118157:39"/>
other particulars. So <hi>Paul,</hi> in the word <hi>Us,</hi> ſheweth that God elected him in Chriſt in particular, in his particular notion, before the world; and the reſt in his particular notion and diſcernment before the world. For it was in Gods power to know particulars of the generalls, as it was to know the generalls, and is.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rufus was choſen in the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking of <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 12</note> him in particular, as <hi>Paul</hi> intended to ſhew that God had choſen himſelfe in particular, and the reſt in particular, in his particular notion.</p>
            <p>I wiſh all would conſider this, that uphold Univerſall Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and anſwer if they can, modeſtly.</p>
            <p>Is there any wiſe man that will give his whole Eſtate, or the price thereof, to purchaſe that inheritance which he knoweth he neither ſhall nor can ever gaine, and have?</p>
            <p>And is there any wiſe man, that having laid out his whole eſtate, to purchaſe an inheritance, that will loſe his purchaſed inheritance, if he can keepe it and hold it?</p>
            <p>Yet you ſay, God the Father gave his onely begotten Sonne, all that he had; and the Sonne gave himſelfe the ineſtimable price to purchaſe, ranſome and redeeme all of mankind for inheritance, which (he knew) he neither ſhould, nor could gaine, injoy, and have; for I think you will ſay, God foreknew all.</p>
            <p>And you ſay, the Father gave all he had, and the Son in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence laid downe all, and paid the purchaſe for all the inheritance, and had power to have and enjoy all, to keep and hold all, and yet ſuffered the Adverſarie to get the greateſt part of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from him, which he had paid ſo deare for, to the utter ruine thereof, and his own everlaſting loſſe, what diſhonour, what injury what folly, what blaſphemy, what Robbery is this offered to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, everliving, juſt, Almighty, mercifull, and moſt wiſe God? The Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt gave himſelfe to Redeem us from all iniquity. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 8. Doubtleſſe the Apoſtle intended this of all that he redeemed. That he redeemed all that he redeemed from all iniquity, for why ſhould his grace pay the price of his redemption, for one given him to redeeme and did redeeme, more or to more benefit for one then for another? (all being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from all iniquitie) all ſhall be ſaved; the iniquity of unbelief can hinder none. Will to believe, or believing cannot further the worke of Chriſts redemption. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>

Will to believe and believing wrought up in the Heart of Man, by the Spirit of Chriſt, doth onely witneſſe the Redemption of Chriſt, and the benefits thereof wrought by Chriſt of Mercy and Free-grace; They do not perfect and finiſh the worke of Chriſts Redemption, which hee himſelfe hath perfected and finiſhed, and is onely able without the work and help of man.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And it is a great help of Chriſt to thoſe which are weak in Faith, incumbered yet, with unbeliefe (as the man in the Goſpel) which ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>I believe Lord: Lord helpe my unbeliefe.</hi> For, they hereby ſeeing the Mercy Goodneſſe, Wiſdome &amp; Power of the Father of Grace, in his chooſing of men in Chriſt, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them to eternall Life. That it was his Will that his Chriſt which hath power to give gifts unto men (as he pleaſeth) and the ſame in meaſure and weight as hee pleaſeth, may alſo ſee that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which came to doe the Will of his Father, doth beſtow Faith and Believing, the gift, grace and fruit of his Spirit here in this life in manifeſtation to themſelves, to witneſſe that they are Gods children, upon whom of thoſe choſen ones, hee pleaſeth that in what meaſure hee pleaſeth, not to all alike, to their great comfort in their weakneſſe in Faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p>And I my ſelf know it is the Commandement of Chriſt in grace to his Church and People, to believe, as alſo to do before men the reſt of the duties of his Commandements, and to be carefull to uſe the meanes of Hearing and Praying for Faith and the reſt; And I my ſelfe have been carefull of the ſame, commanded of Chriſt, for the government of his <hi>Church</hi> upon earth, for worſhip to God, peace and comfort amongſt men themſelves, which all ought to do that beare the name of Chriſtians, and profeſſe themſelves to be Subjects unto Chriſt their King and Law-giver to his <hi>Church,</hi> and

may, and will doe ſo, although they be but naturall Men and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites for formality and reputation, and the reſt in the outward performance thereof before men.

            <p>And this was that which did move mee before, to ſay, and doth now, that my believing in Chriſt &amp; his performances for me wrought up by his Spirit in mee, doth witneſſe to mee that I of Gods Mercy, Love and Free-grace, am choſen of God in Chriſt, to be one of his children, <hi>ordained to eternall Life, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Jeſus Chriſt for me,</hi> and in this Faith (by his grace) I hope to live and die.</p>
            <p>But there are many in theſe dayes in the viſible church of chriſt that profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians and Teachers, which ſay, that they of Mercy, Love, and Free-grace, were not choſen of God in Chriſt before the World, out of the children of wrath to be holy, and without blame before God in love, to be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they were not ordained to eternall Life, and to believe before the World, that they were not loved of God before they were borne, or had done good or evill; that they, when they were borne, were ſtill the children of wrath, and were ſo, after they were borne untill they believed, and ſhould have gone to Hell if they had died before they believed. And they teach all men that this

is their condition, which I thinke is a woefull condition to all that are borne, conſidering that none have the power of their own Life, nor any certainty of Life untill they believe.</p>
            <p>And they teach all, <hi>that God yet ſo loved the whole World of men, being the children of wrath, that he gave and ſent his onely begotten Sonne to die, that whoſoever believe in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life, ſhall be loved, juſtified, and ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they teach, that his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt died upon the Croſſe, in manifeſtation before men, and then the Plaiſter of his Blood and Death was made, and not before, to heale all the wounded children of wrath in the World, that would by Faith apply the ſame Plaiſter of his Blood and Death unto their wounds. And they deny that Chriſt died before God from the beginning, and that this Plaiſter of his Blood and Death, was made before God from the beginning, for the healing of any of mankinde dead and gone before it was made upon the Croſſe, in manifeſtation to Men; and then, and after this applied by the Faith of men: which I muſt needs ſay hath ſeemed harſh and uncharitable to me, that all beeing (as they ſay) the children of wrath, untill the Plaiſter of Chriſts Blood and Death, made upon the Croſſe before men, and applied by their Faith afterwards (ſo made up) to themſelves; And ſo conſequently that all dead and gone before Chriſts Death died in Gods wrath, and muſt needs be gone to the Devill and Hell (there being manifeſted in the Scriptures, no other redemption from the wrath of God, but Chriſts Blood and De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And they teach further, that the mercifull Father ſo loved the World, of the children of wrath, that he did not only give his only Son to die, ſhed his blood and redeem all, pay the ranſome for all the whole World of the children of wrath, which he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all ſufficiently.

            <p>And they teach that God hath left unto all men (being the children of wrath) Free-will and power in their corrupt nature to deſire and will, or not to will and deſire, they may chooſe if they will and deſire; they may heare, if they will, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and receive the Plaiſter of Chriſts Bloud and Death, and if they will, they may apply the ſame to their wounds and be

healed: For, it hath all ſufficient vertues, and in tendered to them.</p>
            <p>And they teach that the Juſtification and Salvation of men (whatſoever the Father, or the Sonne hath done in Mercy, Love, and Grace) conſiſt and reſt in themſelves, their own will, and worke for the Procuring, Setling, Having, and Injoying of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whereby I have thought, that they thinke better of themſelves then they are, and that they are ſome what; when as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they are nothing, and deceive themſelves in their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>

            <p>But tell mee, is there any man that will put a Weapon into any Theeves hand to rob him? Is this wiſdome?

            <p>You ſay God is Almighty, ſo ſay I; But Gods almighty power is alwayes accompanied with his will and good pleaſure, and his Almighty power is alwayes regulated by his will, what he will doe, hee can doe and doth, but what hee will not doe, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe, nor doth: God will not give his honour to any other, nor can: God will juſtifie freely by grace, without mans will or worke; and otherwiſe hee cannot juſtifie.

            <p>4. Becauſe Chriſt the Vine maketh the Elect of God, &amp; is known to beare ſuch grapes, The inſtruments of his Spirit, to hold forth ſuch fruits as are pleaſing and acceptable to God, though man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of himſelf pleaſe God with ſuch of his own.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The promiſe was made not to the ſeede as of man, but to the ſeed as of one, which is Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. agreeing to that word of promiſe, <hi>The ſeede of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>And Chriſt did believe the promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I take it, followeth that the Covenant of grace, and promiſe was made onely to Chriſt, in whom all the Elect of God were as all mankinde was in <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall Creation; And the promiſe was to the Elect as they are in Chriſt, one with Chriſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118157:56"/>
Members of Chriſt. Therefore the Elect in Chriſt are not to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the promiſe of grace made to themſelves, but from Chriſt made to Chriſt, and only made to them, as they are in Chriſt, <hi>in that I live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I live by the faith in the Sonne of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. It is Chriſts faith that <hi>Paul</hi> lived by. It is a common publique confeſſion. Our beſt occaſions are great abominations, and I take it, this is intended of our Believing, Praying, Obeying, Thankſgiving, Repenting, and the like.</p>
            <p>If theſe be great abominations to God, they cannot pacifie nor pleaſe God, neither ſanctifie us to God. Yet Believing, Praying, Obeying, Thankſgiving, Repenting being of the ſpirit of Chriſt The fruits of the ſpirit are acceptable of God, <hi>God is well pleaſed in his</hi>

               <hi>Son Chriſt, and in him only pleaſed, Chriſt maketh requeſt for his ſaints according to the will of God.</hi> Some ſay, Faith is a condition of mans part to be performed of man in Gods Covenant of grace, for the obteining and injoying the promiſe and grace; And before man hath performed the condition of Faith, and believing he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſt in the promiſe nor grace, nor can have, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace is upon mans performance of Faith, as they ſay.</p>
            <p>But I take it, if this were ſo, then Faith is, or was neither a grace of God to man, nor of grace, nor the gift of God to man of grace, but of nature, which is contrary to the Scripture. It is not of our ſelves ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it is the gift of God.</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>Faith is given by the spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>Faith is the fruit of the ſpirit.</hi> Gal. 5. 22.

Some ſay, as when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was quickned to his naturall Life againe by Jeſus, and raiſed out of his grave, hee walked; So when a man is quickened and raiſed up ſpiritually by Chriſt, he is made able to walk in the wayes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God to do the works of godlineſſe, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe.</p>
            <p>But I take it the ſimilitude holdeth only thus, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead naturally before men, and was quickned and raiſed up miraculouſly by Chriſt before men. So the Elect before they were loved and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118157:56"/>
elected in Chriſt out of the company of the children of wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins before God, and after they were elected in Chriſt of God to be holy and without blame before him in love. They were quickned together, and raiſed up together in Chriſt Jeſus before God, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. 5, 6. <hi>And they walked in Chriſt, in all godlineſſe, righteouſnes and holineſſe, before God; But herein the ſimilitude holdeth not that as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and raiſed up by Chriſt to naturall Life, and naturall action, and ſeated in himſelfe by the power of nature left to man though weakned by the tranſgreſſion. So Chriſt quickneth and raiſeth up his Elect to ſpirituall Life, and the power and action of ſpirituall Life inherent, and ſeated in themſelves in the naturall man, either in ſoule or body, as Life of godlineſſe, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, were inherent, and ſeated in <hi>Adam</hi> before his innocency, or as naturall Life, Powers and Actions, (though corrupt and weake) are ſtill inherent, and ſeated naturally in man, and other creatures. For though the Elect of God be quickned and raiſed up to Life, yet this is onely in Chriſt, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5. 6. <hi>God hath quickned us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt: Hee hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> So the Apoſtle, <hi>yet it is not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20</note> I that us now live, but Chriſt liveth in me, and in that, that I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> and ſo againe (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>yee are dead, and your Life is hid with Chriſt.</hi> Col. 3. 3. The Elect are ſtill dead in themſelves, onely alive in Chriſt, hidden in Chriſt, till <hi>corruptible hath put on incorruptible, and mortall hath put on immortality,</hi> then is brought forth the ſaying that is written, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi> In Chriſt wee live, wee move and have our being, meaning of ſpirituall Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 28. our ſpirituall Life, Power, Motion, Action or being is inherent and ſeated onely in Chriſt, not in our ſelves, and is ours onely by gift, imputation, and of grace by our union with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures ſaith, <hi>that God did elect</hi> Paul <hi>in Chriſt before the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4</note> 
               <hi>Foundations of the World, to be holy and without blame before him in love.</hi> Therefore Chriſt was with God before the World, and <hi>Paul</hi> was with God before the World, And ſo the company of the children of wrath were with God before the World, out of which <hi>Paul</hi> was elected and choſen to be loved, holy and without blame before God, that is, to be adopted one of Gods holy and blamleſſe children through Chriſt. Certainly after <hi>Paul</hi> was elected in Chriſt before the world to be holy and without blame before God, and <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:118157:57"/>
adopted one of Gods children through Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the child of wrath againe, by ſinning, nor was unholy and blameleſſe before God, after hee was elected of God in Chriſt to be holy and without blame before God in love, and adopted one of Gods children, but was ſtill holy and without blame before God in Love, although in the fleſh he ſinned, he was ſtill the child of God, <hi>The Foundation of God is ſure, The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have become the child of <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 19 Rom. 11.</note> wrath before God by ſinning, after he was elected and adopted Gods child through Chriſt, hee muſt have been often the child of wrath and the child of God, and often none of the children of God, and after elected and adopted which hath no teſtimony; And if <hi>Paul</hi> was foreknowne of God, and was ſo predeſtinate that he had the gift and calling of God before the World, that he was actually elected and adopted with God, and was ever after loved of God in Chriſt, and holy and without blame before God. No doubt but <hi>Paul</hi> was alſo juſtified and glorified, in which, and through Chriſt before God and with God, before the world unto whom all is preſent, although in reſpect of the creature, and to the creature the ſame appeare, and is manifeſted in appointed and fulneſſe of time. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>hee hath quickned and hath raiſed us up, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Jeſus;</hi> He doth not ſay he will quicken and will raiſe againe. But ſaith thoſe that he knew before he alſo hath quickned, and hath <note place="margin">Rom. 29. 30</note> raiſed up and predeſtinated to be made like to the Image of his Sone. <hi>And whom hee predeſtinated them alſo hee called, and whom he called thoſe alſo hee juſtified, and whom hee juſtified them alſo hee glorified;</hi> he doth not ſay, that thoſe which God knew before the World, and predeſtinated before the World, he would call, and juſtifie and glorifie afterward, but he ſaith, <hi>thoſe that he knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore predeſtinate, thoſe alſo hee Called, Juſtified, and Glorified in preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this notion we may conclude that the World, <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> Elect, and reprobate were with God in Gods Sight before the World was, and Chriſt in manifeſtation of the creature and before <hi>Adam</hi> produced of the duſt, and <hi>Eve</hi> of the rib in manifeſtation to the creature.</p>

And therefore might truly ſay, wee are altogether corrupt, That which is of the Spirit of Chriſt is Chriſts, not mans, as Spirituall Faith, Love, Obedience, Righteouſneſſe, Repentance, all Fruits of the Spirit; They are mans onely as man by grace is made the branch of the Vine Chriſt.

            <p>Secondly, ſhall give account of all done in the body, and by word or deed, whether the ſame be good or evill.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the elected Believers have done, and do in the body (that is) whilſt they are in the Body, evill, in word and deed, as alſo good and that Unbelievers and Reprobates do evil and good alſo.</p>

            <p>Seventhly, to make good their collection, from theſe Scriptures in the Letter, becauſe the Apoſtle of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, in earneſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all Believers, <hi>In many things we ſin all, and all the evill</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 2</note>

            <p>Therefore they adde that God hath his Book, wherein he hath the number of all the ſins and good deeds of men (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>Thou haſt numbred my ſteps, and doſt not delay my ſins,</hi> And God hath the <note place="margin">Job 14. 16.</note> Ballance of his Sanctuary, wherein he ſhall weigh the ſins of men (as he commanded the Prophet) <hi>to cut off the numberleſſe haires of his head (ſignifying the ſinnes of the People) and weigh them in the Ballance;</hi> And God charged <hi>Moſes, that hee ſhould do juſtly in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

               <hi>and will ever doe himſelf.</hi> And God cried, <hi>woe, to the Scribes and Phariſes for omitting the weighty matters of the Law, whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that God weigheth and will weigh the workes of his Law, done by</hi>

               <hi>men.</hi> And as God ſhall finde at the time of his judgement, the ſinnes of men (Believers or Unbelievers) to be in his arithmeticall account, more, or leſſe then his righteous and good deeds, and in his geometricall account, as he ſhall find his good deeds weighty, or lighter then his evill done in the body, ſo he ſhall give to every man as his worke ſhall be, every man ſhall receive according to that he hath done in the body, <hi>whether it be good or evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (ſay they) It is the Juſtice of God (which is alwayes mixt with mercy) That to the man whoſe good deeds overcome his bad, the good reward ſhould be given unto him, and that hee ſhould receive the ſame which the Apoſtle proveth in plaine words (ſay they) <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradice of God.</hi> See more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. and <note place="margin">Rev. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet further they adde, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, the unjuſt ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of Heaven, That the man which overcometh in the number and weight of his good deeds, becauſe <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13</note> the works of every man followeth (as the Apoſtle ſaith) his works follow him; They and their workes muſt (before they ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Heaven) go through Purgatory; The evill of the workes muſt be burnt, and themſelves purged with the fire of purgatory (which <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 13. 15</note> they confirmed by the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>It ſhall be revealed by fire, The fire ſhall try every mans worke of what ſort it is, but hee ſhall be ſafe himſelfe, yet as it were by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they adde further, that whereas ſome of the ſinnes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not unto death, called veniall ſinnes, which are to be prayed, and offer pardon for, upon repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for repentance thereof (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>there is a ſin which is not unto death for which let him aske, and God ſhall give him Life for the ſinnes which</hi>

            <p>In ſingleneſſe of Heart and ſincerity, farre otherwiſe, how and wherefore ſhould hee bee ſaid to worke in Believers, the Will and the Deede? and to worke all in all, if it were not that hee worketh theſe and ſuch like things of his owne good pleaſure in them, which their owne corrupt power they have, cannot worke, and doe, in ſingleneſſe of Heart, unfainedly, and without diſſimulation.

And this was the cauſe and reaſon why CHRIST did ever ſithence his Church was upon Earth, give his Spirit to the Elect of God, for whom hee had undertaken of Grace and Love, to doe ſuch things of the Holy and Good Law, for the Government of his Church, as is commanded therein, to bee done before men, which hee knew themſelves not able to doe (as hee pleaſed.) And therefore the true Faith, Peace, Obedience, Repentance, Praiſe, and Love are called Spirituall gifts, Spirituall things, Spirituall Sacrifices, and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 1. 1 Cor. 14. 12. 1 Cor. 9. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> why ſo? certainly becauſe they are the Deeds of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the fruit of the Spirit, as ſo the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.

Covenant-maker of Grace, and promiſe to his <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all his Elect.</p>
            <p>For where all Mankinde (having tranſgreſſed againſt the Covenant of Workes before God) were in the ſtate of eternall Death, the God of Love, Mercy, and Free-grace (having elected ſome of them in his <hi>Chriſt)</hi> with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe of Grace, that upon his <hi>Chriſts</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law of Workes; And the paying of the whole Tranſgreſſion of the Law by his Death, Paſſion and Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding, for them his Elect to ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Thoſe his Elect ſhould have eternall Life, the condition, and promiſe of the covenant of Workes, as if themſelves had performed the ſame, to the full, and ſhould bee alſo freed from the penalty of Eternall Death, into which, all Mankinde was fallen.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done and fulfilled the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and paid the full Debt of the Tranſgreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to God, by his Paſſion, Death, and Bloud-ſhedding for the Elect, even to the full, ſo much as the Law, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Workes required, in Juſtice, either for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before God, or for payment of the Trangreſſion to full ſatisfaction of God, for thoſe Elections, for ever, for paſt and to come.</p>
            <p>Now then why ſhould the Law and covenant of Workes remaine ſtill, binding the Elect Believers to righteouſneſſe of Workes before God, which they cannot in the leaſt doe, and for that in reſpect of their utter unableneſſe CHRIT undertooke and performed all for them? And if CHRIST (God being ſo pleaſed) have fulfilled the whole Law both for performing the righteouſneſſe thereof before GOD, and payment of the tranſgreſſion thereof; Why ſhould not <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee the end of all Law Morall, and the reſt for righteouſneſſe before God to Believers? as they ſay hee is the end, of, and for the penalty and condemnation, for the tranſgreſſion thereof, to them? Seeing the full is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the righteouſneſſe required as the full of the Debt of tranſgreſſion is paid? Will theſe lay ſuch cruelty upon God, and charge God with ſuch oppreſſion, and wrong,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118157:68"/>
as to take his whole Debt of Chriſt, for the poore Elect ones (not able to pay a Farthing of that they ought him) and yet to keepe them in Bonds ſtill, to require that Debt of them ſtill, which was fully paid, and did acknowledge himſelfe fully ſatisfied? Men will abhorre that Man for an unjuſt oppreſſor; That having a poore Man bound to pay him a great Debt, (utterly unable to pay any thing) if his Friend have paid him all the Debt to the full, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, keepe the poore Mans Bond, hold the poore Man bound ſtill, and require ſome, or what hee loſt, of the poore man ſtill to bee paid of him, not able to pay any thing.</p>
            <p>And how great is the diſhonour, and injury unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Wiſe, Gracious and Mercifull Saviour, Undertaker, and Redeemer of his Elect Believers to charge him with regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, careleſneſſe and indiſcretion to undertake to pay, and pay the whole Debt to God for the poore Elect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and not to make their peace, not to take out their Bond, and have them acquitted of the Debt ſatisfied, but to leave them ſtill in Bond; The Debt ſtill to be required of them, not able to pay the leaſt mite thereof? When as Chriſt our gracious Undertaker ſaith by his Apoſtle, <hi>Hee hath put out the Hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, Hee hath taken it out of the way, and faſtned it upon His</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 14</note> 
               <hi>Croſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay the penalty of Tranſgreſſion is taken away by <hi>Christ,</hi> but the Law and Bond remaine ſtill; Whereby the Elect Believers are ſtill bound to doe the Righteouſneſſe of the Morall Law before God. That is (I take it) ambition without Law, or Reaſon; For, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) when there is no Law, there is no <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 13</note> Sinne; ſo when there is no penalty there is no Law, no penalty, no Law binding, for it is the penalty that is the Bond of the Law; It is the penalty that maketh the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law. No Man will take upon him to command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a power to puniſh the Delinquent, and Tranſgreſſion of his Commandement, much leſſe will the great and wiſe God doe ſo, when as his power of penalty is gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:118157:69"/>
If Chriſt have taken away the penalty for not doing the righteouſneſſe of the Law from Believers, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſſe before God to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, although the Law for righteouſneſſe before Men remaine ſtill to Believers, in the Hand of the Mediatour the Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>World, and was Man made actually, in Gods ſight, before Man was made in manifeſtation to the Creatures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, that muſt needs be ſo: for otherwiſe the acts which are of God ſhould not be eternal with himſelf in Gods reſpect, but ſeparable from God; his Will and Decree ſhould not be his act: and it would not have been ſaid, that God calleth things that are not, as if they were: otherwiſe all things and times ſhould not be preſent with God, to whom there is nothing paſt, nor future, as is to man.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; Gods Will, Purpoſe, and Decree, is his act with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own ſight.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How could Man cloſe and conſent to the Covenant of Works, with God, b fore the World, when as Man was not created and made in manifeſtation to any creature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It was juſt and righteous that <hi>Adam</hi> did cloſe with God in the Covenant of Works, after his creation and making in manifeſtation: And the wiſdom and righteouſneſs, whereby and wherein he did cloſe with God then in the Covenant, was the ſame wiſdom and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God which were eternal with God: Therefore wherein <hi>Adam</hi> did cloſe with God after his Creation in the Covenant of Works, ſo (he being actually in Gods ſight before the world) did cloſe with God before the world in the decree and act of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in Gods ſight with man before the world.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Did God give Adam power and free-will, in his own ſight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, as he had when he was made in manifeſtation, to keep the Covenant for himſelf and his poſterity, and live ever; or to break the ſame if he would, and dye eternally, as the children of wrath?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Gods Will, Decrees and Acts are eternal with himſelf unalterable; and ſo the ſame power and free-will which <hi>Adam</hi> had in manifeſtation given him, he had before the world in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Was</hi> Adam <hi>and all Mankind in him dead before the World, and become the children of wrath for breaking the Covenant in Gods ſight before the world?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it was his mercy, love, goodneſs, wiſdom and counſel, for them he pleaſed of the dead children of wrath, that the Chriſt ſhould undertake to perform all the Will of God, to the ſatisfaction of Juſtice, for thoſe choſen of God in Chriſt fully, in preſent before God, and in future for manifeſtation to the creature, That ſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in Chriſt ſhould have reſtored in Chriſt all loſt in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion that God endowed Mankinde withall before himſelf, or in manifeſtation to the creature, as life eternal in Chriſt, holineſs and righteouſneſs in Chriſt, power and honor in Chriſt, &amp;c. For as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had all theſe in him, for all mankinde in him, to have been manifeſted to them and in them in the fulneſs of time, if the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his integrity: So Chriſt, the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hath all in himſelf, for all the choſen of God in him, Eternal life, holineſs, righteouſneſs, power, honor, and glory, &amp;c. to be manifeſted to them and in them in the fulneſs of time.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, that muſt needs be ſo; otherwiſe they ſhould not be that which God did chuſe them unto in Chriſt: otherwiſe Chriſt ſhould fail in his undertaking to do the Will of God for the Elect in him: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſome things might be layd to the charge of Gods choſen, which the Apoſtle ſaith ſhall not be. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33</note>

               <hi>A.</hi> It was the fleſh and corruption in <hi>Paul,</hi> not <hi>Paul</hi> as he was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in Chriſt: he did it in ignorance (as he ſaid,) <hi>It was not I</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Acts 3. 17 1 Tim. 1. 13</note> he) <hi>that did it, but ſin that dwelleth in me:</hi> This is the ſtate of the beſt of Gods choſen ones, They ſin continually in themſelves, they are holy and without blame, and righteous before God in Chriſt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14 15, 18, 19</note>

            <p>Q. <hi>It ſeemeth then, that the Elect of God themſelves can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that pleaſeth God, nor do any thing that displeaſeth God; Is this ſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is certain God is onely pleaſed in Chriſts doings and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances for man, and in man; not in mans doings and performances, which are always corrupt, and leavened with ſin: and Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the wrath of God for their ſin, hath already ſatisfied God, and ſtopped Gods diſpleaſure and wrath to their ſins. Indeed, in his Juſtice without Chriſt, God is ſaid in the Scriptures to be angry and diſpleaſed with ſin; but if God be angry and diſpleaſed ſtill, where Chriſt hath ſatisfied and appeaſed, who ſhall ſatisfie and appeaſe? If God be angry ſtill, when Chriſt hath finiſhed his ſatisfaction, who ſhall ſatisfie afterward?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith, That the Ethnicks, which have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but of the children of wrath, do know the law or righteouſneſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31</note> 
               <hi>of God, how that they which commit ſuch things as are contrary, are worthy of death, and their thoughts or conſciences are accuſing or excuſing one another; and this they have by the corrupt light of</hi>

               <hi>Nature left them: Therefore the Ethnicks know when their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſeth them, that they displeaſe God in their performances; and when their conſcience excuſe them, that they pleaſe God in their performances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is certain, the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> and all natural men know the Law of God, yea that which is to be known of God (as the Apoſtle ſaith) enough to charge their conſciences with good and evil, with life and death, in their performances. And although their accuſing conſcience do manifeſt to them, that they diſpleaſe God, and are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death for committing ſuch things; yet their excuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot aſſure them, that they pleaſe God by any of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Although I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>yet I am not there by juſtified;</hi> I have no aſſurance that thereby I pleaſe God, although my conſcience excuſe me.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Was not the Law written in Tables of ſtone by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and given after by</hi> Moſes <hi>to the Church of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the choſen people of God, then in viſibility? the ſame Law that was given of God to man, when man had power to perform the ſame before his Fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was the ſame partly in matter and wholly in form of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118157:75"/>
and righteouſneſs, but not the ſame in condition and circumſtance. For firſt, The Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> was by God as the Creator, when man had power in himſelf to have performed the full righteouſneſs of the ſame before God and man; but <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, ſo called, was given, by God the Undertaker and Redeemer of Gods choſen, to them, when they had no power to perform the righteouſneſs of this Law before God, nor of that Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Law was, That man ſhould do it and live evermore, and ſhould dye eternally if he did it not; but this Law is, That man <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 3. Luk. 10. 18</note> ſhall have temporal reward, long life upon earth, and the like, if he doth it, and ſhall have temporal death and puniſhment if he doth it not, or doth the contrary to it; ſo held forth in the whole diſcourſe of this Law written.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that Law Juſtice had only place, <hi>If thou doſt this thou ſhalt live, If thou dost not this thou ſhalt dye;</hi> but in this Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> faith in Chriſt, ſelf-denyal, prayer and repentance have place; and upon faith in Chriſt, ſelf-denyal, prayer and repentance, mercy and forgiveneſs have place: but neither faith in Chriſt, ſelf-denyal, prayer, repentance, mercy, nor forgiveneſs have place in that Law only of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice made and given of God to man in power; and if prayer, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, mercy and forgiveneſs had had place in that Law, no doubt but the good God would of Juſtice have had patience for <hi>Adams</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for <hi>Adam</hi> in time might have repented, had mercy, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and lived eternally, and his poſterity, and ſo there ſhould have been no need of a Chriſt, a Saviour and Redeemer of man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Preface to the Decalogue, where it is ſaid, <hi>God ſpake theſe words and ſaid, I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage, &amp;c.</hi> do ſhew plainly, the giver of this Law was our God, and Chriſt the Undertaker, Redeemer, Saviour, and Deliverer of Gods choſen people in grace, and that the ſame was given in grace for the Government of his Church and people, for worſhip to God before men, for righteouſneſs, ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſafety among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> requiring performance of the righteouſneſs thereof before God and before men; but this Law was given requiring performance of the righteouſneſs thereof only before men: for if this Chriſts Law were for performing of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before God, as <hi>Adams</hi> Law was, with condition of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death for breaking of the ſame, then ſin would have the dominion, then all the choſen of God ſhould be under the Law of death, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118157:75"/>
not under the grace of life, becauſe no man can keep this Law in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before God in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Have Gods Elect power to perform the righteouſneſs of this Law of Chriſt before men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Law of Chriſt is outward in appearance to men, and <hi>man ſeeth but according to the outward appearance;</hi> and this Law is inward <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 7 Rom. 7. 14</note> and ſpiritual, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Law is ſpiritual.</hi> Now as this Law is outward in appearance to man, man hath power to perform the righteouſneſs thereof before men: for although the power of man be ſo corrupted that he can perform no righteouſneſs before God, yet he may perform the righteouſneſs of the Law in appearance before men: So Chriſt ſaid, the Phariſees did perform the outward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this Law before men: and <hi>Herod</hi> did many things in the righteouſneſs of this Law as he was taught of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> called his performance of the righteouſneſs of this Law his <hi>own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phi. 3. 8, 9</note> 
               <hi>which he deſired he might not be found in,</hi> but <hi>counted the ſame loſs and dung in compariſon of the righteouſneſs which is of Chriſt: David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandments;</hi> and <note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 32</note> 
               <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>walked in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord without reproof of men.</hi> So we ſee that men may <note place="margin">Luke 1. 6.</note> perform the righteouſneſs of this Law of Chriſt before men in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to men, yea hypocrites, as the Phariſees and <hi>Herod,</hi> much rather the choſen people of God, which have the work of the Spirit thereto in their ſouls and hearts. If man had had no power to perform the righteouſneſs of this Law before men, it had not been love nor juſtice in Chriſt to have charged Gods choſen people to perform this Law upon pain. There is no juſt and charitable man that will lay a burden upon his beaſt that he knoweth he cannot bear.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But can the Elect of God perform this Law of Chriſt as it is ſpiritual?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, that cannot be; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin and tranſgreſſion,</hi> meaning of the Law as it is ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is this Law of Chriſt given to Gods choſen performed of them, which cannot perform the ſame themſelves as it is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt their Undertaker and Giver of this Law as it is ſpiritual doth perform the ſame in them by his Spirit promiſed and ſent unto them; and this is the ſpecial cauſe of the ſending and giving of the Holy Spirit to Gods choſen people to act the ſame in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118157:76"/>
to evidence and witneſs to them that they are Gods choſen in Chriſt, and his adopted children through Chriſt; and that Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in himſelf and in them are all imputed to them, and made theirs by his grace of imputation; therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do, Lord, that which thou commandeſt, and command what thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth not mans performance of this Law as it is outward in righteouſneſs before men pleaſe God, and juſtiſie the performers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, for then they that ſhew unto men that they do perform the duties of this Law, as that they beleeve, love, pray, give thanks, repent, ſhew mercy, and forgive, &amp;c. ſhould all pleaſe God, and be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God; then the Scribes and Phariſees, and other like hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, ſhould have pleaſed God, and been juſtified before God, and <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf ſhould be juſtified before God; for although <hi>Judas</hi> did wickedly, yet it is written, that <hi>Judas repented himſelf</hi> before men to give ſatisfaction to men for his repentance, therefore it is written, <hi>he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3</note> 
               <hi>repented;</hi> but this outward performance did not juſtifie any of theſe before God, nor pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth not the performance of this Law (as it is inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual) made by the Spirit of Chriſt in man, called therefore ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, ſpiritual faith, ſpiritual love, ſpiritual repentance, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, that cannot be: for although the performance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf be righteous in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> yet this performance being made with the inſtrument of corrupt man, his corrupt heart, ſoul, or members, the ſame cannot be pure, as coming through corrupt man, in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> (as pure water coming from a pure fountain through a defiled conduit or channel cannot be pure (although ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable ſomeway) in the end:) To this the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified:</hi> He doth not ſay, by mans own works of the Law, or by the outward works of the Law, but by the works of the Law, whatſoever they be, outward or inward: for indeed this Law was not given to juſtifie men before <hi>God,</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, but for the government of Chriſts Church upon Earth, and by the ſpiritual performance thereof to evidence and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Gods</hi> choſen people, that they are the children of <hi>God;</hi> for if they find in themſelves the faithful performance thereof in ſingleneſs of heart, they may thereby know, that they have received the Spirit of Adoption, and <hi>the ſame Spirit doth witneſs with their ſouls that they are the children of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16</note>

Q. <hi>We ſee that Chriſt in this his Law commandeth his people to perform the Law as it is ſpiritual, to do the inward and ſpiritual work of his Law; he requireth truth in the inward parts, obedience and ſervice in ſingleneſs of heart, love without diſſimulation, prayer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, repentance from the bottom of the heart, which man himſelf, being carnal, ſold under ſin and tranſgreſſion, as</hi> Paul <hi>was in his beſt eſtate, although choſen of God, cannot perform: Why doth Chriſt command the choſen of God to do the ſame that he knoweth they cannot do, and for the performance of which in them he promiſeth, ſendeth and giveth his holy Spirit to them (as he pleaſeth?)</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. Is there no difference of the outward performance of this Law of Chriſt in Gods choſen people, and in Hypocrites, in appearance to men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, there is much difference in appearance to men: For, firſt, the choſen of God have the work of the Spirit in their ſouls and hearts (when it pleaſeth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) ſanctifying and ſweetening the outward performance with humbleneſs, meekneſs, and otherwiſe, in appearance to men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They do it ſimply in ſubmiſſion and obedience to the command, accounting the ſame good and fit to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one before men, without the command preſſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They do not think that the doing of the work of this Command of Chriſt before men reacheth unto God, to pleaſe God, to move and pacifie God; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My well-doing extendeth not to thee, O Lord; but to the Saints upon the earth;</hi> for their good and profit, that they ſeeing the ſame, may glorifie their Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 3</note> before men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They do it not for their own profit, glory and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men, as a merit of their worl. in their own eſteem; but they wait and reſt upon the promiſe of the reward in his Law made to the conſcionable performers thereof, in the gracious judgment of Jeſus Chriſt, before men; giving Chriſt, the Commander and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, King and Governor of his Church, the honor of all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>But the performance of hypocrites, firſt, have not the face of the ſanctifying and ſweetening Spirit in humbleneſs and meekneſs, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, and otherwiſe: for although the Phariſee went up into the Temple to pray, yet his performance had the face of pride and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, not of true humbleneſs and ſelf-denyal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They do it, but not ſimply in ſubmiſſion to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118157:78"/>
as good and worthy to be done without the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but they do it, being commanded, for company, formality, and avoyding of penalty and other danger.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hypocrites do the work of the Command often zealouſly, herein thinking in their hearts, that their performances thereof reach unto God, to pleaſe God, to pacifie and move God thereby to do them and others good, (which is onely the work of Chriſt to Gods choſen ones) wherein they would convey the honor of Chriſt to their performances.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hypocrites are ſtrict and preciſe in this, as it is outward, (none going beyond the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> therein,) not for the honor of Chriſt the Lawgiver, but for their own honor and reputation among men; for their own ends; for their own gain, profit, and advantages; ſeeking the ſame often unjuſtly, to the damage of one, for the benefit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to their own praiſe and glory among men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. May not Gods choſen people neglect and omit the outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Law of Chriſt before men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No; for Chriſt hath given it to them in grace, and in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs, thereby to govern his Church and people upon Earth, for his own worſhip, honor, and their good, peace, comfort, ſociety, and ſafety; the which whoſoever doth neglect, omit, and deſpiſe, doth manifeſt himſelf to be none of Gods choſen people, none of the choſen of Chriſt. Whoſoever profeſſeth himſelf to be a ſubject to an earthly King or Governor, and deſpiſeth to ſubmit, in performance, to his wholeſom Laws and Ordinances, diſſembleth, and is in truth no Subject to the King or Governor: So it is with him that profeſſeth himſelf to be a Chriſtian, if he refuſeth and deſpiſeth to ſubmit, in performance, to the moſt wholeſom Laws of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Government of his Church upon Earth before men, he is no Chriſtian, but an Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. We finde it clear in the holy Scripture, that God anointed, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſent before himſelf his Son Jeſus Chriſt to three Offices, for the government of his Church upon Earth, of a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet; and he did execute the ſame Offices by himſelf in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, being upon Earth, in his Church; and hath ever, and will execute the ſame by his inſtruments upon Earth: for</hi> the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Iſai. 9. 6</note> is <hi>ever</hi> upon his ſhoulders; He is a Prieſt for ever. <hi>And we find in his viſible Church, he called and ſent</hi> Moſes <hi>his Miniſter and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>

So the Apoſtles called and ſent</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>and others, and adviſed them to call and</hi>

Now what is to be thought of thoſe which contemn and deſpiſe this Ordinance of God and his Chriſt, which deſpiſe his Ordinance of calling and ſending his inſtruments, called and ſent by ſuch his Miniſters and inſtruments as were ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſent for the government of his</hi> Church <hi>upon Earth; which deſpiſe ſuch Paſtors and Miniſters ſo called and ſent, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word and Sacraments, their long teaching and feeding of Gods people with his Law for government, and his Goſpel for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting comfort, by the performance of Jeſus Chriſt for them? And which call and ſend themſelves, or are called and ſent by others, which were not called or ſent by ſuch as were called and ſent, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts Ordinance, to feed and teach Gods people by his Law and Gospel, (as they profeſs?)</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And to thoſe that call themſelves, or are called by others, not call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to Chriſts Ordinance, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that climbeth up to the ſheepfold another way, is a thief and a robber.</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>Doth that Law of Chriſt, firſt manifeſted and exbounded by Moſes as Chriſt appointed to Gods choſen people the viſible Church of Iſrael, continue in force to all the viſible Churches of Chriſt in the World, for the Government of Chriſts Univerſal Church in every particular Nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Moſes</hi> expoſition of that Law by Chriſts appointment to that Church, there were many Sacrifices, Ceremonies and Figures conſtituted, which had relation unto Chriſt to come in the fleſh, and to perform the work of his coming before men, and thereupon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:118157:80"/>
many Judgments to that Nation peculiar, which (as they had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſts coming, and performances, and to that Nation pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar) are ended, and the Law touching them: And that is one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the Apoſtle hath, where he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to all Beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the moral and equity of all that Law of Chriſt, as it is fitting to Chriſts Church of Gods choſen people in all Nations, is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Government of his Church upon Earth for worſhip to God, for peace, ſociety, comfort and ſafety to the ſame; ſo held forth by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, with ſome alterations in way of the Government, in reſpect of thoſe which were then in relation of Chriſt to come, and now of Chriſt come, and the gracious manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereof by the more glorious Goſpel of Salvation to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Beleevers, by the performances of Jeſus Chriſt, fully finiſhed in the ſight of men and Angels.</p>
            <p>Certainly none of Chriſts Church in any Nation decline the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and equity of this Chriſts Law, ſo gloriouſly eſtabliſhed by Chriſt himſelf, by Inſtrumental Headſhip, Governors, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sacraments, Miniſters, Miniſtry, and Maintenance; and for that the Miniſtry of the moral and equity of this Law of Chriſt is now more honorable in reſpect of the Miniſtration of the gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhining Goſpel therewith, which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the miniſtration of the Law in glory;</hi> but ſuch as are hypocrites, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 8, 9.</note> profeſſing themſelves to be of his Church Subjects, and the choſen people of God, and are not in truth and appearance; and there are too many of theſe now.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, I ſay, for Elimozinary maintenance of called and ſent Miniſters of Chriſts Law and Goſpel, there is no witneſs or preſident in the Scriptures: It agreeth not to the honor of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, that the Miniſters thereof ſhould be beggars of their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; we know alms, and beggars, and relatives: and the Holy Ghoſt noteth in Scriptures, that begging is a mark of unrighteouſneſs and reprobation: for <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I never ſaw the righteous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See Pſal. 109. 10 Pſa. 37. 25 Luk. 16. 3</note> 
               <hi>nor their ſeed begging their bread:</hi> Therefore the aſcription of Elimozinary and begging maintenance to the Office of the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal honorable Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt, is antichriſtian, and diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although we finde in the Scriptures, that Prieſts and Prophets, being Miniſters of our God, ſometime were put upon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary maintenance, or miraculous, in times of perſecution: and the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118157:81"/>
Apoſtles, his Miniſters, were put upon like arbitrary and miraculous maintenance, according to the wiſdom and good pleaſure of our God, in the alteration and change of the Levitical Prieſthood, and in the beginning of Chriſts gathering of Believers of Chriſt come in the fleſh, and his performing of all before men to mans ſalvation, according to the Scriptures, and in the perſecutions of adverſaries in thoſe times: yet all theſe did not deſtroy the Law and and Ordinance of Chriſt, ſetled and eſtabliſhed for certainty of the maintenance of his Miniſtry continuing in the moral and equity of that firſt eſtabliſhed Law, for the Government of his Church upon Earth, in the continuance of the world to the end thereof, in all Nations, (where and as he pleaſeth) as in the moral and equity is moſt fit. And is not the righteous Law of Chriſt, and the Miniſtry thereof, as it was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as uſeful and neceſſary to the Church of Chriſt in all Nations, in the moral and equity thereof, for Government, as it was to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Is it not as uſeful and neceſſary to Believers of Chriſt come in the fleſh, and that he hath performed all to mans ſalvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, as it was to Believers that Chriſt ſhould come in the fleſh, and perform all to mans ſalvation before men? And is the glory and honor of the maintenance of the miniſtration of the glorious Law of Chriſt abated and demoliſhed in the miniſtration of the moral and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity thereof, accompanyed with the exceeding ſhining and glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, and that he hath performed all before men undertaken of him for the ſalvation of man, to their everlaſting comfort, according to the Scriptures? Certainly the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws of our God and Lord Chriſt, which he firſt manifeſted, written in Tables of ſtone, to his Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church in all Nations in the moral and equity thereof, for worſhip to God, for righteouſneſs, peace, ſociety, ſafety, and comfort among men themſelves, notwithſtanding all or any eclipſes through alrerations, changes, perſecutions thereof, by the providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wiſdom of God therein before men, is uſeful and needful ſtill. Certainly the need and uſe of the Law of Chriſt is as much now in the moral and equity thereof to Believers of Chriſt come, for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. as it was then, in any way, to Believers of Chriſt to come.</p>
            <p>Certainly the Miniſtry and Miniſters thereof, in the moral and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity thereof, for Government, &amp;c. in all Nations of Believers of Chriſt come, &amp;c. are as uſeful and needful ſtill; yea as glorious and honorable as ever they were, and more glorious and honorable then
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118157:82"/>
before the Goſpel, the glad tydings therewith of Chriſt come in the fleſh; and to have performed all before men to mans ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And certainly the certainty of maintenance, appointed, layd out, and eſtabliſhed by Chriſt himſelf, to the Miniſtry and Miniſters of that viſible National Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in his incomprehenſible wiſdom, as beſitting, uſeful, neceſſary and requiſite, is ſtill, and ſhall be to the end of the world, ſitting, uſeful, neceſſary, and requiſite to the Miniſtry and Miniſters of Chriſts perpetual honorable Law, for his Government, in the moral and equity thereof, to his viſible Church in all Nations of the World, where the Chuch of Chriſt is National, as it was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudea:</hi> And this maintenance now to exceed that of the Miniſtry of the Law to that Nation, by the addition of the glorious miniſtration of the Goſpel, the work of Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, and to have performed all before men for mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>And certainly the maintenance of the Miniſtry of the Law of Chriſt, for Government of his Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> layd ont and eſtabliſhed there and then, in the incontroulable wiſdom of the Son of God, our Chriſt and Lawgiver, for the certainty of the maintenance thereof by Tythes and Offerings, and the reſt; The ſame Law, Government, Miniſtry and Miniſters, in the moral and equity thereof, remaining and continuing to all Nations to the end of the World, where the Church of Chriſt is gathered in like manner nationally and viſibly, the ſame maintenance by Tythes and Offerings is ſtill, and ſhall be to the end of the world, in the wiſdom of Chriſt, beſitting, uſeful, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and requiſit there; There being in all Nations the matter of Tythes and Offerings remaining, and in being, at leaſt to anſwer the moral and equity of the Law and Ordinance of Chriſt. And the acuteſt wiſdom of corrupt man, in laying out maintenance of the Miniſtry and Miniſters of the Law and Goſpel of Jeſus by other certain arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or Elimozinary maintenance (as have been by corrupt man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly propounded) is but fooliſhneſs with God (as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.) And certainly Gods people, that are led by the Spirit of Chriſt, will ſubmit to the manifeſted wiſdom of Chriſt, for the Government of his Church in all Nations, and the maintenance thereof layd out by Chriſt. And I muſt, forced by Religion, add this further, for the evidence of the wiſdom of Chriſt manifeſted to men, in laying out and eſtabliſhing by Law and Ordinance Tythes and Offerings, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the maintenance of the Miniſtry and Miniſters of his Law and Goſpel in all Nations, where his Church is gathered Nationally
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118157:82"/>
and viſibly; That Chriſt did not lay out theſe, as of that which was mans, but of that which was Gods, which was his own, and not mans own; therefore in the Law are called <hi>the Lords Offerings, the</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:118157:83"/>
Alteration, change, and perſecution made ſometime a ſtay of the manifeſtation of the Ordinance of our God and the Lord Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but his Ordinance remained ſtill.</p>
            <p>God made the Sun to rule and govern the day, and the Moon to rule and govern the night, by his perpetual Ordinance, and of all thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>The Sun and the Moon are ſometime in the Eclipſe; ſometime the Moon changeth before men, and the Sun and the Moon go down in appearance to men; yet the Sun and the Moon remain ſtill to govern the day and night, and ſhall do as long as the day and night remain: Even ſo the Law of our God Chriſt, being ordained and made by him for the government of his Church, his Miniſtry, Miniſters, and maintenance thereto, uſeful, and neceſſarily belonging, in the moral and equity of his Law, are as uſeful and neceſſary for the government of his Church upon Earth, as long as his Church remain, as the Sun and Moon are uſeful and neceſſary to govern the day and night; and ſhall continue <hi>non obſtante.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee this weariſomneſs, this ſnuffing at the burthen of Tythes and Offerings, which our God and Chriſt reſerved to himſelf to be at his diſpoſition in the government of his Church upon Earth, from the beginning to the end, for homage, worſhip and honor, and the reſt, to the good of men: And alſo the robbing of the ſame by curſed Hypocrites, ſeeking in the ſame their own gain and honor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, is no new thing, no new attempt; but as it was then, ſo it is now. But I wiſh all to conſider of the words of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſpeaking in the times, the change, and in the times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?</hi> And again, <hi>Let him that is</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Wo be unto them, for they have followed the way of Cain, and are caſt away by the deceit of Balaams wages, and periſh</hi>

               <hi>in the gainſaying of Corah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The way of <hi>Cain</hi> was (we know) that although he had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, to bring the beſt of his fruits for Tythe or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord; yet for gain to himſelf did rob God of the beſt, and like a diſſembler brought of the worſt, or ſuch as were not worth the acceptance.</p>
            <p>The deceit of <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, whereby he was caſt away, was, for that he knew the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be bleſſed of God, Gods choſen people, yet for wages and gain he would have done them any miſchief he might.</p>
            <p>The periſhing and deſtruction of <hi>Corah</hi> was his ſlighting and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of the Ordinance of Chriſt in the Miniſtry, and Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of called and ſent by his Ordinance, for the gain of honor, and the reſt, to himſelf.</p>
            <p>His woe was not againſt <hi>Cain, Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Corah,</hi> but againſt thoſe, and ſuch in the laſt days, that walk in their ways; who in pride
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118157:84"/>
and covetouſneſs of the riches and honors of this world trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, his Laws and Ordinances for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church upon Earth, his worſhip and honor among men, &amp;c. and for righteouſneſs, peace, ſociety and ſafety among men themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is not this Law of Chriſt, given to his Church of Gods choſen people, Iuſtification before God, and eternal Life to the keepers and doers of that Law and Commandment, for or by the keeping and doing thereof before men; and condemnation before God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, to the neglecters and breakers thereof before men, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and breaking the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, that cannot be ſo; for the holy Scriptures ſhew plainly the contrary in many places.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, and all Gods choſen people, <hi>He hath choſen us in Chriſt before the World, to be holy and without blame before him in love:</hi> which muſt needs be underſtood thus; God foreſeeing and foreknowing before the world all men to become the children of wrath by tranſgreſſion, he of love and free grace was pleaſed to chuſe ſome of them, then before himſelf, to be his adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children through Chriſt, <hi>to be holy and without blame before him in love;</hi> and being choſen, are juſtified, and have eternal life in Chriſt. So the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the world, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>We were all the children of wrath as well as others</hi> before God, before that (of Gods love and free grace) we were choſen in Chriſt out of the general company of the children of wrath, to be the children of God; but now being choſen in Chriſt to be the children of God, we are not, nor can be the children of wrath again: for Chriſt loſeth none choſen in him; none taketh them out of his hand, that the Father hath given him. Now to affirm, and hold forth, that Juſtification and eternal Life cometh to man for or by his keeping and doing of the Law and Commandment of Chriſt, given to Gods people, and in Tables of ſtone written, long after Gods Election of them before the world, manifeſted in the Scripture; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and eternal death cometh to them for the breaking and neglecting thereof before men, is to diſable, diſhonor, and nullifie the gracious act of Gods Election in Chriſt (of thoſe he pleaſed) before the world, to be his loved children, and to leave the reſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their own tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is God that juſtifieth them:</hi> being choſen of God, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33</note>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:118157:84"/>
they are juſtified of God: none, after they are choſen of God, ſhall or can lay any thing to their charge; therefore their Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or condemnation, eternal life, or eternal death, doth not depend upon their keeping or breaking the Law of Chriſt, given for the government of his Church upon Earth, although indeed it may manifeſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If Iuſtification before God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life be of the Works of the Law, they are not of Grace:</hi> But the Apoſtle affirmeth, That Gods choſen are juſtified freely by grace, and not by the Works of the Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle citing other Scriptures, ſaith, <hi>Before Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob and Eſau were born, and had done good or evil; that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God might remain according to Election, not by works, but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11 13</note> 
               <hi>by him that calleth; God loved Iacob, and hated Eſau:</hi> It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, of love and free grace, had Elected <hi>Iacob</hi> in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, that God continued his love to <hi>Iacob;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> was left in the wrath of his tranſgreſſion in <hi>Adam,</hi> that God continued his wrath and hatred to <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, If mans Juſtification before God ſhould depend upon his keeping and doing of the Law and Commandment of Chriſt, there were no man could be juſtified and ſaved: for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In many things we offend all:</hi> and his repentance that is finite and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, could not ſatisfie the treſpaſs done before and againſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God; which it muſt do in juſtice, if Chriſts Law were, with condition of everlaſting life and everlaſting death, for keeping and breaking of the Commandment.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is there no good nor benefit to Gods choſen people by keeping and doing the Law and Commandment of Chriſt carefully and in ſingleneſs of heart, nor no damage nor danger to them by breaking and neglecting the ſame before men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Gods choſen people have two ſpecial benefits by the keeping and doing of the Law and commandment of Chriſt before men in ſingleneſs of heart and carefully.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They have the temporal reward in the condition, promiſed and held forth in the holy Scriptures; <hi>In keeping of them there is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 19. 11 &amp; 58. 11</note> 
               <hi>great reward</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:)</hi> And again, <hi>Doubtleſs there is a reward for the righteous:</hi> And they have much more then is manifeſted, prepared of Chriſt for their reward of grace:) <hi>The things which eye hath not ſeen, neither ear hath heard,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9</note> 
               <hi>neither came into mans heart, hath Chriſt our God prepared
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118157:85"/>
for them that love him,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, They have the evidence of the Spirit of Chriſts work in their hearts: for the carefulneſs and ſingleneſs of heart is the work and fruit of the Spirit, which they, as branches of the Vine Chriſt, do onely bear and bring forth of grace, as inſtruments wherewith the Spirit doth the work, and imputeth it to them of grace; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was not I, but the grace of God with me:</hi> And the Spirit, by <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10 Rom. 8. 16</note> ſuch evidence received, doth witneſs to their Souls, that they are <hi>Gods children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the damage and danger to Gods choſen people is great, by breaking and neglecting this Law and command of Chriſt. For firſt, they loſe the ſaid reward of keeping and doing the ſame; when they break it and neglect it, they forſake their own mercies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are liable to the temporal penalties, and are ſure thereof without repentance of their offences before men: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that Chriſt our God ſhaketh his rod of Judgments ſo often in the Scriptures againſt the choſen people of God, which (he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) in themſelves are frail, weak, and ſubject to temptations, to keep them from tranſgreſſion, and the danger thereof.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the good and benefit of the Gospel, and the preaching thereof unto Gods choſen people? Is it beyond and more then the Law, and preaching of the Law of Chriſt, for the Government of his Church upon Earth, unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; the Goſpel, and the preaching thereof by thoſe that are ſent, is for their everlaſting comfort and good; That ſetteth forth unto them the everlaſting love, mercy, and free grace of God, in his chuſing them in Chriſt before the world, unchangeably; their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to eternal life, their predeſtination to be the children of God for ever, their calling thereto in the Image of his Son <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>A.</hi> All ſuch Precepts and Exhortations of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, are, not to charge the Elect with performances of duties before God by thoſe precepts, which they are in no part able to perform, ſithence man loſt his power of performing; but to ſhew, and ſet forth to the Elect and Reprobate, the power that <hi>Adam,</hi> and all mankinde then in <hi>Adam,</hi> had, to perform all thoſe Precepts and Exhortations before is Fall, in the ſight of God; and to ſhew the authority, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and righteouſneſs of the Command in commanding thoſe holy and good duties; and the juſtneſs of God in the fearful and miſerable penalty of the tranſgreſſion, to be certainly executed upon the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſuch as are without Chriſt, the Redeemer and Performer of thoſe precepts for them; having by their own fault, when they had power, loſt their power of performing: And to ſhew, that as the tranſgreſſion of the reprobate encreaſe and multiply, ſo the penalty and miſery encreaſeth and multiplyeth dayly; and that by ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, continually proclaimed by the Miniſters of God, the reprobate may be abated of their envious and miſchievous tranſgreſſion, to the greater ſafety of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>And yet further, theſe precepts were written, that the Elect of God, finding in themſelves no more power left to perform them, then the very reprobate have, which is only before men, may behold (their blind eyes being opened by Chriſt) the unſpeakable love, mercy, and grace of God towards them, in their Election, in the promiſed ſeed to them and for them; in the performances of Jeſus Chriſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed of thoſe holy precepts, firſt and laſt, for them, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neither had, nor have, any power to perform, ſithence the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fall and loſs.</p>
            <p>Further yet, Chriſt in his Evangeliſts and Apoſtles writings doth hold forth theſe precepts to the Churches, that the faithful, hearing and ſeeing theſe Precepts and Commandments, which were ordained to life, but are now unto death, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which was ordained unto life, was found to be unto me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

               <note place="margin">Mat. 23 37</note> that ſo, their eyes being opened by Chriſt, to ſee the goodneſs and love of Chriſt the love of Chriſt might conſtrain them to yield their hearts and members inſtruments of his love, to God and man, before men, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The love of Chriſt hath conſtrained us.</hi>

            <p>But becauſe ſome of unbelievers yet may be of the elect ones, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, I did it in unbelief ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he perſecuted: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Miniſter of the ſpirit, may and doth hold forth amongſt theſe <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.

And the knowing and manifeſtation of this, cometh to believers, by the grace of believing given to them (being the fruit of Chriſts ſpirit in them that believe) whoſe hearts and ſoules, Chriſt hath made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his grace of faith and believing.

And that they are freely juſtified by his grace, fulfilling of the Law, and his performances for them. And that he is ſtill a King, a Prieſt and a Prophet, to rule, keep, preſerve, and do all things for them, and in them, making their members his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the righteous works of his ſpirit in them, until he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them blameleſs at his coming to judgment, which deſire to know nothing, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified (as the Apoſtle of Chriſt <note place="margin">1 Co. 2. 2.</note> ſaith he did.) To ſuch believers the pure Goſpel of Jeſus belongeth to be preached, and the Law in grace for government before men; for ſuch are not under the Law, but under grace, That the means of the <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 10</note> manifeſtation and witneſs of the ſpirit which is Chriſt ſpeaking of the word of grace by the mouth of his Miniſters (for it is not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ſpeak, but the ſpirit that ſpeaketh in them, (as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples that he ſent to preach the Goſpel) may be, as ſincere <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 20.

            <p>Yea further, that were to aboliſh Chriſt and grace, and to nullifie Chriſt and his grace: ſo the Apoſtle of Chriſt holdeth forth, <hi>If it be of works, it is no more of grace, elſe were work no more works,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it be in any part of works and mans performances to have peace <note place="margin">Rom. 11 6.</note>

            <p>To this purpoſe the Apoſtle of Chriſt ſaith alſo, <hi>I ſay unto</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>If a man may not think and account himſelf to be more holy,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2 4</note> 
               <hi>more righteous, and better then himſelf was before in Gods ſight, or more holy, more righteous, and better then other men, which are without doing the works of the holy Commandment.

This Doctrine will quench all devotion, goodneſs, juſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and duties to God and man; for wherefore ſhould a man do theſe and the like, if he may not think himſelf the better, more holy, more righteous in Gods ſight by doing, nor be more holy, more righteous, and better by doing, then other men that do nothing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Doctrine doth not quench or abate true devotion, or any thing of goodneſs to God in truth; but maketh way to the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the true light to man, whereby he may be better indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with God through Chriſt, according to true ſpiritual manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For manifeſtation of the true light herein firſt is to be conſidered, that whatſoever devotions, or prayers, man hath, or doth perform of himſelf, in his own wiſdom and power, or whatſoever works he doth, or deviſeth to do, according to the rule of the Law and holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of works either towards God or man, for his own bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118157:91"/>
for his own eſtimation of more holineſs and righteouſneſs in himſelf before God, (he deceiveth himſelf) to man, there may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation by ſuch devotions and performances, but not to God; for God knoweth that man in his meer natural eſtate, (for his eſtimation with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n) may be ſo acted by the ſpirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that he may ſhew, and do all theſe things, and all other outward things of the holy Law, and Commandement outwardly, as fully as may be ſeen of man to be done; which for proof thereof, we may clearly ſee in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> eſpecially of the Phariſees whom no man (now living) in devotions and outward performances of the holy Law can be ſeen to go beyond, and they were never the better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but the worſe thereby, as appears by the woe, that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them for their hypocriſie in ſuch their devotions, and <note place="margin">Mar. 23. 14.</note> performance of the Law, to be ſeen of men, to get eſtimation among men.</p>
            <p>Again, (God knoweth) that man himſelf hath no power at all, nor will, unto good, that he loſt theſe in the firſt tranſgreſſion. And that man himſelf can do and perform nothing that is good before God; for <hi>Paul</hi> a principle example, one that had then received of Chriſt as much as any man had, or have acknowledged, that he in himſelf found no <note place="margin">Rom 7. 18. Pſ. 14 3. Rom. 3. 10, 11, 12.</note> means to perform that which is good. And <hi>David</hi> (a man after Gods own heart) and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no man that doth good, no not one.</hi> Then how can any man think, that he is the better, the more righteous in the ſight of God in Gods eſtimation by his own devotions, prayers, &amp; all his own outward performances of the holy Law of God, done in the greateſt wiſdom of man, no, they are no better in the eſtimation of God, then the devotions of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their performances, which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mentioneth were ſuch as God was weary of, were abomination to him and he hated. Man cannot make himſelf better to <note place="margin">Iſa. 1 12. 13.</note> God; it is Chriſt that maketh him better, it is Chriſts performance that maketh man better to God, more holy, more righteous in the eyes of God, then he was before.</p>
            <p>Yet (ſo it is.) That Chriſt by whom God hath given all to his elect ones (of his great grace) maketh them (as he pleaſeth) his inſtruments in the way of their Pilgrimage of the performances of the holy Law and Commandement, as devotions, prayer, preaching, hearing, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, love, juſt dealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through his holy ſpirit in them, where by they ſhine as many lights amongſt men, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace: yea though they be mightily wrought upon by the ſpirit of Chriſt in them to mortification of ſin in their earthly Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118157:91"/>
to ſanctification, and the purifying of their hearts by Faith; yet they think not themſelves better by any thing in them of their own: for they acknowledg, that in themſelves dwelleth no good thing (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) they acknowledg the fleſh and corruption ſtill remaining in them, as in others, and they give the praiſe and glory of all good to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein is the chief diſcernment of thoſe which are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſpirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which are wrought up many times to as great performances as the inſtruments of the ſpirit of Chriſt are, and thoſe which are <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> boaſt of theſe as their own to their own praiſe among men. But thoſe which are Chriſts, put off all praiſe, of whatſoever from themſelves, giving all to the praiſe and glory of <note place="margin">Act. 3. 12. 16. Act. 14 15 Rev. 22 9.</note> God, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>healing the lame man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, when they would have ſacrificed to them, oh (ſay they) <hi>we are men, ſubject to like paſſions as ye be,</hi> and (as the Angel did, where <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipped him) ſaying <hi>(I am thy fellow Servant) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that uphold this objection want two things, firſt, the ſpirit of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> Chriſt, whereby they diſcern not: <hi>the ſpiritual man diſcerneth all things,</hi> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, as to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the <hi>Galathians, Philippians, &amp;c.</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> as knowing that then the ſpirit of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was buſie, and afterwards would be buſie to puff men up with a conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which corrupt man is prone unto, that they are ſomething, and can do ſomething of the Commandement before God; yea ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they can do all, as the ruler ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>all theſe have I kept</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>from my youth.</hi> Yea ſome ſay, they can do all, by the help of God, by the grace of Chriſt, and by the power that God hath given them; As the Phariſee, I thank God, I am not as other men, extortioners, unjuſt adulterers, or as this Publican, I faſt often, I pray, I give tithe <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> of all I poſſeſs: mark <hi>the Phariſee thanketh God for all theſe he did boaſt of;</hi> ſurely he acknowledged he had power, or grace, or help from God in theſe performances, and yet was leſs juſtified, then he that confeſt he had done nothing, or failed and ſinned in all theſe. And ſome thinking to modefie the injury to Chriſt, ſay, that though they do not the work of the Commandement alone, yet they cooperate with Chriſt, having a ſhare in the work of the Commandement done, which they ground much upon a ſaying of a Father in the Church,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118157:92"/>
which is, God hath made thee without thy ſelf: but he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee without thy ſelf: which ſaying is true, thus, man was not with God in the making of man, but man was with God in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of man, it was <hi>Emanuel</hi> that redeemed man. For God did aſſume fleſh, Chriſt was made of a woman, that the promiſe might be fulfilled. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> But this doth not prove, that man doth cooperate with Chriſt in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and performances to his peace with God to the remiſſion of his ſin; juſtification, and ſalvation. <hi>O Iſrael,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationn</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>is of thy fleſh, thy ſalvation only of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work of mans Redemption, reconciliation to God, and of Gods reconciliation to man, of forgivneſs of ſins, his juſtification, ſanctification, and glorification, is all Chriſts wholly in himſelf: no part there of is mans. And whoſoever denieth this, denieth Chriſt to become in the fleſh: for to deny him in part of his work and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, is to deny him in all his work and performances. To deny part of Chriſt, is to deny whole Chriſt: <hi>For Chriſt will have no partner</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13 Colloſ. 3. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 6</note> 
               <hi>in his work. Chriſt is all and in all, and he walketh all in all,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.)</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How can all good performances to God and man, approved in the holy Teſtament, as faith, love, thankfulneſs, joy, humbleneſs, reverence, peace, meekneſs, all goodneſs, as righteouſneſs, mercy, gentleneſs, patience, temperance, &amp;c. be wrought and made in man by the ſpirit, (that is the Holy Ghoſt in him) when as theſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, many of them, are made to God alone. How can the ſpirit pray to the ſpirit, give thanks to the ſpirit, beleeve in the ſpirit, be humble to the ſpirit, and the reſt. This holdeth forth abſurdity, that the ſame, ſhould perform to the ſame. That a man ſhould pray and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt himſelf, be humble to himſelf, is abſurd to affirm. So to ſay the ſpirit maketh requeſt to himſelf, is thankful to himſelf, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is abſurd indeed to them that conſider of the ſpirit, in the unity of the God-head: But the ſpirit is to be conſidered, as the third perſon of the God-head, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, ſent to Gods Elect, by the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, God and man; from which Father, the ſame ſpirit deſcending by a mighty voice from Heaven, ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne,</hi> being then a <note place="margin">Mark. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in the behalf, and for the performing the gracious Offices of the Sonne. So it plainly appeareth by the words of Chriſt, <hi>I will pray,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now this ſpirit, ſent of the Father and the Sonne to the Elect, to be a Repreſentative of Jeſus Chriſt, after his going out of the earth, from them; for to do and perform for them, that which they are not able to do and perform, in their ſtate of nothing to good, (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith of all) <hi>If any man ſaith he is ſomewhat, when as he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>he deceiveth himſelf:</hi> Therefore as Jeſus Chriſt, had undertaken to do all for the Elect, to the Father fore-paſt, and to come, and did all undertaken, then to be done of him during his being upon earth, (as amongſt the reſt.) To pray to the Father for them, to give thanks for them, to believe for them, to rejoyce for them, to be humble and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the Father for them. So this was the gracious care of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to provide after his departure a Repreſentative of himſelf, for their comfort, even his holy ſpirit to do all things for them, and in them, to the pleaſure of the Father, in his name and behalf making and fitting them in their ſeveral Members of ſoul and body, to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch his performances. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, his tongue was made <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 1.</note> the pen of a ready Writer: we know the Pen is but the inſtrument of the writer, no more was the tongue of <hi>David;</hi> but the inſtrument of the Oracle that ſpake, the ſpirit was the ſpeaker. And ſo when he ſaid before, his heart was inditing of a good matter, (he doth not ſay the inditer but inditing) he mean th that his heart was the inſtrument of the ſpirit, which was the inditer of the good matter, his heart it ſelf not the inditer of the good matter, no more then his tongue was the writer thereof, which was but only the inſtrument of the writer. The of a good matter may aſcribe, and account the writing writer thereof to the pen. And may ſay, my pen writ this thing; but the common reaſon of man knoweth that the writer himſelf did ſharp and fit the pen, yea and lead and guide the pen every way: otherwiſe the pen could have done nothing in writing, the pen would have laid ſtill.</p>

Even ſo Jeſus Chriſt, which by his ſpirit, his repreſentative, is the inditer of all, the writer of all, the doer and performer of every good matter in man, of his love and grace to man his creature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, may, and doth aſcribe, impute and account all to be mans, and his members inſtrumen's fitted by him, lead, guided, and inabled by the ſpirit, to bear and hold forth the ſame, which otherwiſe could do nothing of the good thing, but would lie ſtill, thereunto (as <hi>Paul</hi> was, when he ſaid) <hi>I find no means to perform that which is good;</hi> yea, ſaith he there, <hi>when I would do good, evil is preſent with me, and the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 7. 18</note> 
               <hi>good which I would do, that I do not; but the evil which I would not do, that I do:</hi> wherein the Apoſtle ſheweth, that when Jeſus Chriſt by his ſpirit, had framed and fitted his will to good, that was not enough for him to do it: But Jeſus Chriſt by his ſpirit, muſt go on with the inſtrument of his will, which he had fitted to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the deed and performance, in fitting his other Members alſo for inſtruments of the deed to be performed by his holy ſpirit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe though there was will ready, yet the deed would be wanting. Therefore the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is God that worketh in us, both the will and the deed of his own good pleaſure.</hi> In which words, the <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> Apoſtle ſheweth, that it is our God that worketh the will to good, and the good deed alſo: therefore the will is Gods, and the deed is Gods, not mans, except by aſſcription and imputation, and man is not, nor can be the inſtrument of the good, unleſs firſt fitted by the ſpirit of Chriſt, to be the inſtrument of the good deed, no more then the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10.</note> pen can be the inſtrument of writing well, without ſharping and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it. And theſe words alſo hold forth, that when Chriſt hath wrought up the will, his working of the deed may be wanting yet, at his pleaſure; yea, but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>evil was then preſent with him,</hi> he was ready to do evil, when the ſpirit had fitted his will unto good, <hi>and the evil which he would not do that be did,</hi> even as a captive and bond-man to act ſin of himſelf, and nothing but ſin can a man do of himſelf, or doth, which notwithſtanding is abated, and ſtayed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, as it pleaſeth: ſo that, at all times, the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do what it would, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit is contrary and against the fleſh, that it cannot do what it would,</hi> no more then the <note place="margin">Gal. 5 17</note> will framed by the ſpirit, can bring to paſs what it would through the hinderance of the fleſh; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they are contrary one to another, that ye cannot do what ye would.</hi> So that, to conclude, all good performances in man are Jeſus Chriſts performances, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative the Holy Ghoſt, brought forth and done of him by, or
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118157:93"/>
with the inſtrument of the members of man, together, or ſeverally, framed and fitted for the work: Even as the body and his members are the inſtruments of the Soul, and therefore is called the Organ of the Soul, and can do nothing at all without the Soul: So the Soul and body both are the Inſtruments of Chriſts Spirit, without which they neither of them can do any thing that is good before God, and are in the doing only the inſtruments of the Spirit of Chriſt: and yet by grace, in the word of grace, thoſe doings and works of the Spirit are called and accounted mans, and ſo accepted, through Chriſt, of God the Father.</p>
            <p>And all the ſin and evil done, is mans own act, even of the fleſh and corruption of ſuch as are Believers; <hi>In me</hi> (that is, in my fleſh, ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>dwelleth no good thing:</hi> yet this ſin done of the Elect in <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18</note> the fleſh (though yet unbelievers) is taken away by Chriſt preſently, as it is done; yea was virtually taken away by the Fathers D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Q. <hi>Are there not ſome Hypocrites of ſuch as profeſs themſelves to be ſtedfaſt Believers in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; there are four ſorts of men, that profeſs themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, that are Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>The firſt are ſuch, which notwithſtanding they will ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt to be ſaved by him, yet they hold themſelves under the moral Law, the Law of Commandments, the Law of Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as man was before he fell, and is after, not being in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath undertaken and done for them, the moral Law is ſtill a rule which they of neceſſity muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and do the commands thereof before God unto life, as being left in ſuch bonds by Chriſt; otherwiſe they believe they cannot be ſaved by Chriſts performances: For, ſay they, <hi>Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it:</hi> which Scripture they do, and muſt <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17</note> needs take thus, to uphold their diſſembling believing in Chriſt, That Chriſt did not, by his coming, take away the power, command, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and bond of the Law from his Ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But alaſs, what benefit ſhould the Elect have by Chriſts fulfilling of the Law for them, if Chriſt ſhould have left them under the power, command, and bond of the Law ſtill?

So if Chriſt hath fulfilled the Law for his Elect, and left his Elect ſtill in bond to the Law, and under the command and power of the Law before God, what benefit have the Elect by Chriſt fulfilling the Law for them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> But they underſtand not the words of Chriſt rightly, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Chriſt came not to destroy the Law,</hi> that is, not to take away any power, command, bond, or penalty of the Law, touching the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which he came not to fulfil the Law for; yea, nor to take away the Law in all reſpects touching his Elect: For it is the juſtice of Gods righteous Law, that he continually pleadeth to and with the Father for his Elect, that he hath fulfilled all for, and done all for, for their peace with God: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate</hi> (that is, a Pleader of Law and Juſtice) <hi>with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1</note>

               <hi>our ſins.</hi> It is the Law and Juſtice of God that Chriſt pleadeth for his Elect, which he payd the uttermoſt farthing of their bond and debt to God for, by his righteouſneſs, ſuffering, and performances; whereby he obtaineth diſcharge from them of the binding Law, and is the propitiation for their ſins; And (ſaith the Apoſtle touching the Elect) <hi>He hath put out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>

               <hi>us</hi> (meaning of all Laws before God) <hi>which were contrary to us, he even took it out of the way, and fastened it upon his Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that of the Apoſtle (touching the Elect) where he ſaith, <hi>Sin ſhall have no more dominion over you; for ye are no more under the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14</note> 
               <hi>Law, but under Grace,</hi> doth ſtill make more for their diſſembling in believing: For the Apoſtle ſaith, Sin hath no dominion or power over the Elect, becauſe the Law hath no dominion or power over the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; <hi>they are no more under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt needs conceive the Elect are in truth diſcharged, disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and freed from the dominion and power of the Law before God, that is, the commands and bonds thereof, before they are or can be diſcharged, unburthened, and freed from the dominion and power of ſin before God, which is the curſe and death. And this Chriſt ſhewed in the order of his work to both: For firſt, Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſs of the Law in his life before men, that ſo the power and dominion of the Law, in the commands and bond thereof, might be anſwered and ſatisfied before men; for this command and bond was but that the Law might be kept and fulfilled of man: And then when he had fulfilled the command and bond of the Law, he payd his death and blood for the tranſgreſſion of the Law, both made in <hi>Adam</hi> actually, vertually, and ſucceſſively, of all the Elect of God then in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns, whereby Chriſt leaveth not his Elect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the command nor bond of the Law, which is the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and power thereof; not under the penalty, curſe, and death for ſin and tranſgreſſion of the Law, which is the dominion and power of ſin. Chriſt hath diſcharged his Elect, both of the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Law, and of ſin and curſe.</p>
            <p>And yet this ſort of diſſembling Believers, not here ſatisfied (as men not humbled truly, but deceived by the ſpirit of Antichriſt, which ever exalteth man) will ſay, They are not blocks and ſtones unto good unto the holy commandment; They can endevor, and muſt; They have power in themſelves, if not to do all, and follow all the rule of the Commandment before God, yet by the leave of God, by Gods grace, and by the help of Chriſt, they may: So that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118157:95"/>
they have power enough of their own to do and follow the rule of the Commandment before God, if God will give them leave, and give them grace to do and follow it; at leaſt, if Chriſt doth help them in the work, if themſelves be not ſtrong enough: Herein hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But God hath revealed to his Elected Believers, that they know that themſelves loſt all power, will, and inclination, to the doing any thing at all of the holy and juſt Commandment of God in Gods ſight, in the firſt ſin and fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> meaning in the eſtimation of God; and they know there remaineth to themſelves no power, will, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to good, as in themſelves, and of themſelves before God; as <hi>Paul,</hi> an Elected Believer, acknowledged of himſelf; <hi>I find no means,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to perform that which is good before God: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

And they know, that in themſelves <hi>dwels no good thing,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,) <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3 8</note> but that they are <hi>miſerable, wretched, poor, blind, and naked in themſelves.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And they know, that God (knowing the loſs, weakneſs, and want of power in his Elect, unto all good before him did therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fore-purpoſe and love, give and ſend his Chriſt, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all power, righteouſneſs and wiſdom of the Godhead, to perform all before God, touching the holy Law and Commandment for them, and in their behalf, unto their ſalvation, without charging upon his Elect any performance of Law and Commandment at all before God, which they (he knew) had no power to do and which Chriſt had undertaken to do for them, and had performed already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. When a debt is payd, Juſtice doth not require it again: and therefore the Elect do not ſtand bound or charged before God with the bond, commandment, or rule of the Law, upon neceſſity to

their ſalvation. And they know, that God did never hinder, diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or diſcountenance any man, in, or from the works of his holy commandment; and that Chriſt is no ſuch helper to man, to perform the good work, as an additional power to the power that man hath of his own: But that Chriſt is the whole power, and the whole workman of the work, and man, or any member of man, onely the inſtrument, which he of his grace having ſitted as he pleaſed to make uſe of, in the work of godlineſs and goodneſs.</p>

            <p>And for a man to ſay, he loſt all power in <hi>Adams</hi> fall to do the Commandment before God, and yet to ſay, he believeth (if God will give him leave, if God will give grace and favor, if Chriſt help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him) he can do it, or ſomething of the commandment, is meer halting, hypocriſie, and diſſembling.</p>
            <p>For, for a man to ſay, he loſt all power, and to have ſome power ſtill, is to diſſemble.</p>
            <p>For a man to ſay, that God commandeth him to do a work, and to queſtion his leave to do it, is to diſſemble.</p>

            <p>The ſecond ſort of hypocrites in believing, are thoſe, which ſay, They believe to be ſaved by Chriſt, if they ſtand and held in the ſaith; but they believe they may fall away from the faith, and commit ſuch ſin, as may ſhut them out from ſalvation by Chriſt, and from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſaved by him, and ſo be in the ſtate and danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet upon repentance may have forgiveneſs then granted of God, and may believe again to be ſaved; and ſo may fall and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118157:96"/>
often in their life: and as they dye in either ſtate, be ſaved, or damned.</p>
            <p>Which manner of believing (pretended in the true God and Chriſt, holden forth in the Word of Truth and Grace, to be a God and Chriſt of certainty, conſtancy, juſtneſs, grace, unchangeable, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6</note> clearly appeareth to be hypocriſie and diſſembling in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: For their believing is, indeed, in a God and Chriſt that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, inconſtant, not juſt, and in his grace changeable, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that he hath done and covenanted of his free grace, according to the inconſtancy and changeableneſs of weak, frail and failing man, which of himſelf hath no power to do good before God, to believe, to repent of evil, and ſo to continue; but to ſin onely, and to do evil: The true God (true Believers know) is a conſtant God, that loveth thoſe which he loveth to the end; which according to his endleſs love Elected thoſe, which he of free grace did love, in and through <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1</note> his Chriſt, to be redeemed and carryed on to their ſalvation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his unchangeable love and purpoſe, by the performances of his Chriſt, the full furniſhed undertaker for them all, without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or conſideration of mans weakneſs frailty, doing, changing, or failing: for this was his Covenant of grace, which otherwiſe had been no Covenant of grace; but an harder Covenant to man, now in weakneſs and frailty, yea in bondage of ſin, then the Covenant of Works was to <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had power and freedom of Will.</p>
            <p>And true Believers know further, that Chriſt is unchangeable and ſure in all he undertook for the beloved choſen of God; and that he hath done all for them, and payd all for them in himſelf, and will certainly preſerve and keep them all to be <hi>preſented blameleſs at his coming to judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore their believing of their poſſible often falling from, and riſing to Salvation again by Jeſus Chriſt, grounded either upon God, his Chriſt, or man himſelf, is but a fiction of another God and Chriſt then the word of Grace holdeth forth, and a making mans ſalvation to depend upon himſelf, not the true faith, but a falſe, halting, and diſſembling ſaith, yea to hold forth God and his Chriſt inconſtant, changeable, unjuſt in Covenant and promiſe, failing in undertaking and performance, is blaſphemy, <hi>Rabſheka's</hi> blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>The third ſort of profeſſing Believers in Chriſt, which are hypocrites in their believing, are ſuch as hold forth in their believing univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt Death and Blood, which, ſay they, was payd for all mens tranſgreſſion, for the Redemption and Salvation of all men, as

a price ſufficient for the ſame, but not to be effectual and efficient to the unbelievers thereof: That it is their believing only that maketh the price payd for their Redemption to be effectual to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>This believing is ungodly and antichriſtian believing, for it exalteth man and mans own work, to mans own ſalvation, above Gods and Chriſts work, above the vertue of Gods love, free grace, truth, and Chriſts blood and performance, undervaluing all of God and Chriſt to mans work of believing to his Salvation; as if the price of Chriſts blood, and the precious blood of Chriſt, were but a dead thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the life and ſoul of mans believing, to act and effect the ſalvation of man: Herein is horrible blaſphemy againſt God and Chriſt, Gods love, free grace, Truth, Chriſts blood and performances: For Gods love, purpoſe, decree, Covenant or Promiſe of his free Grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, his Chriſts precious blood and performances for mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are the whole cauſe, both material and effectual, efficient, formal, and final, of mans ſalvation, without any dependance of man, or his doing, to the ſame. Mans believing is no efficient or cauſe thereof, but God only. <hi>Salvation is of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>Our God is the Salvation of Iſrael: There is no Salvation</hi>

            <p>What need more teſtimonies of Scripture for mans ſalvation only to be by God? his love, grace, decree, purpoſe, and his Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and performances to be perfected certainly to thoſe which God did love; to be elected and predeſtinated, to be called, juſtified, and glorified by his Chriſt, and his performances, for them undertaken, and all faithfully and effectually performed by him, before men, in his obedience, ſuffering, croſs, death, and reſurrection.</p>

            <p>And whereas they pretend mans believing to be the efficient cauſe that only maketh Chriſts Redemption effectual to man; it is certain by the Scriptures, that man hath of himſelf, or in himſelf, as of himſelf, no power to believe in Chriſt, or his Redemption, as he ought to believe, no more then he hath to pray as he ought to pray: Now the Apoſtle ſaith, no man knoweth, or hath power to pray, as he ought: <hi>We know not to pray as we ought, but the Spirit maketh</hi>

And further he ſaith, <hi>We cannot think any thing of our ſelves that is good;</hi> if not to think to believe in Chriſt, much leſs to <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5</note> believe in Chriſt, to believe his Redemption: And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one;</hi> if no good, then not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <note place="margin">Pſa. 14. 3</note> in Chriſt, for that is a great good thing.</p>
            <p>It is the Spirit, ſent by Chriſt to man, that hath the power to do the good work of praying and believing for man; <hi>The Spirit it ſelf</hi> (that is, alone) <hi>maketh requeſt for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, not man himſelf: Indeed the Spirit fitteth the Soul, or heart of man, to be his Inſtrument in the work of believing, as the pen is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the writer in his writing; but the believing is no more mans Believing, then the Writing is the Pens Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>The Spirit openeth the blinde eyes of mans ſoul, (as the Prophet <note place="margin">Pſa. 146. 8 Iſai. 29. 18 &amp; 35 5 &amp; 42. 7</note> ſaith,) and holdeth forth Jeſus Chriſt, and his Redemption, by his precious blood payd, his juſtification and ſalvation, by the ſame and other his performances, and by the power of the enlightening, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and guiding of the Spirit, the blinde eyes of the Soul, opened, are the inſtruments of the Spirit, fitted to behold, ſee, and apprehend Jeſus Chriſt, his Redemption made by the price of his blood payd, his Juſtification and Salvation wrought out: So that the believing of Gods Elect is none of their own work, but the work of the Spirit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way; it is onely the manifeſtation and evidence of Chriſt, &amp;c.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118157:97"/>
made by the opening the blind eyes of the reaſon and underſtanding, to let in Chriſt, and to be inſtruments for apprehending and applying the ſame to the ſoul: And ſo the Apoſtle deſcribeth or defineth faith; <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the evidence of things that are not ſeen: Faith is</hi>

            <p>Theſe premiſes plainly conclude, that ſaith is not the cauſe efficient, or maker of the Redemption of Chriſt, effectual to man the believer; nor the antecedent to juſtification, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to ſalvation; but only the ſubſequent, conſequent, or fruit following the manifeſtation and evidence of the ſame, to the elect Believer, where it pleaſeth God to beſtow this grace upon his Elect.</p>
            <p>And charity will not ſuffer us to doubt, but that many which die before faith is manifeſt in them, are of Gods Elect: For (no doubt, but that the juſt God giveth his Chriſt: all thoſe he paid for with his precious blood; And that neither the Devil, Hell, unbelief, nor any ſin can take them out of Chriſts hands, nor hinder him of thoſe he <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 12. v. 28.</note> paid for.</p>

            <p>The fourth ſort of profeſſing believers in Chriſt, which are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, are ſuch, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>that turn the grace of God</hi>

And for that the Prophet ſaith, all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, being believers, are laid upon Chriſt. And for that the Apoſtle ſaith, he hath born them already upon the tree in his body, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 6.</note> them away with his blood. There is no conſcience or queſtion (ſay they) to be made of ſinning, or not ſinning, grace hath made no ſtop or exception of ſinning.</p>
            <p>This believing is ungodly, and like to the womans <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the faith and believing, which is the fruit of the ſpirit, is quite contrary believing; for although the true ſaith, which is the fruit of the ſpirit of Chriſt, apprehendeth the love and grace of God in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, in the promiſe, in the laying of all their ſins and iniquities upon Chriſt, and in Chriſts bearing them in his body upon the tree, and in his waſhing them away by his blood. Yet they which have this true faith, do not believe that Chriſt leaveth them there to themſelves, to live after the fleſh licenciouſly with looſe reigns of ſinning. But they beleeve the free grace of God, that hath done theſe great things for them, through Jeſus Chriſts performances, will go along with them,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118157:98"/>
and teach them, that is, fit them, inable, direct and guide them as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his ſpirit, to denie ungodlines and worldly luſts, and to <note place="margin">Tit. 2 11.</note> live ſoberly godly, and righteouſly in this preſent world.</p>
            <p>That the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt will fit them to be his inſtruments of <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13</note> mortifying the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit, and lead them, that they ſhall walk after the ſpirit, and favour the things of the ſpirit; yea that the more they have of the ſpirit in them, the more the fruit of the ſpirit will appear in them, in all manner of goodneſs, and leſs of the fleſh unto ſin and wickedneſs. The more of Chriſt they have, the more will Chriſt and his righteouſneſs ſhine in them. The manifeſtation of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> the ſpirit, ſaith the Apoſtle, is given to every to profit, or do good withall, where good is not the ſpirit is not, where ſin is abounding, the ſpirit is wanting. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>No man, ſaith the Apoſtle, can call Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, but by the <note place="margin">Mar. 7. 1.</note> Holy Ghoſt, meaning, except he be an Hypocrite.

            <p>And that the Laws given by man to the republique and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereof Chriſt is the head, King, Governor and Law-giver only, are not of bounden duty and Conſcience to be obeyed.

            <p>If thoſe I ſay which hold forth Chriſt thus unto men, do alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold him forth, to have all power to good, all good, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, holineſs, and true goodneſs in himſelf alone; And that by his own ſoul and abſolute power he doth all good things, whether good rule, Government, Order, Law-giving; yea, love, joy, peace, patience, meekneſs, righteouſneſs, temperance, yea all goodneſs whatſoever, as he pleaſeth in his univerſal national poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, parochial particular Church, and in any member of any of them, through his holy and incomprehenſible ſpirit in them, ſent unto them for their comfort, keeping, preſerving, and fitting to the Kingdom of glory, and the praiſe and glory of his grace for ever.</p>
            <p>And that every good thing among the Sons of men, done in truth, Gods ſight good, ſo done, and is the deed of Chriſt himſelf, by his powerful ſpirit, and not of the will of man, but of the will of God only.</p>

And if thoſe do acknowledge, that in man as himſelf dwelleth no good thing: And that in and of himſelf he hath no means to perform that which is good before God, as <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of Chriſt did <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18</note> confeſs and acknowledg of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And that they have no power to good, before God, or can think or do any good themſelves of themſelves, but that they know they are wretched, miſerable, poor, blind, and naked.

               <hi>in our prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if thoſe will acknowledge this undoubted truth, That although man cannot do theſe, or any good things of himſelf of the holy Law, and Commandment before God: yet becauſe it pleaſeth Chriſt, all ſuch works of righteouſneſs and goodneſs, ſhould be done among his Elect, and other, to the glory of the Father in Heaven, in the way of mans pilgrimage, (as Chriſt ſpeaketh,) <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorifie your Father which</hi>

               <hi>is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that Chriſt therefore hath ſent his holy ſpirit to his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, national, political, parochial, or particular Church, (all being but one Catholique Church, though ſevered into particulars) and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very member of the ſame, to bear and hold forth ſuch fruit of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of all manner of goodneſs, as ſhould be moſt fit and moſt behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all or any of them, for the glory of the Father, and their comfort, whether it be the goodneſs of ruling, governing, ordering, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teaching, obeying, ſerving, loving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of his great grace to man, to make and fit corrupted man in his Members of ſoul and body, (as he pleaſeth) to be his inſtruments of ſuch his good and righteous works, beſt befitting publique and private, univerſal, national, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, parochial, and every particular Church, and every member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in their Relations to the glory of God, and the good and comfort of his elect people.</p>

himſelf by his ſpirit did them. As if a writer of a good matter ſhould ſharp, fit, lead, and guide his pen wherewithall he writeth, and ſhould afterwards praiſe his pen, and ſay, my pen writ this good matter.</p>
            <p>Certainly man is no more the doer of the good of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, then the pen of the writer is the writer of the good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>And why ſhould men queſtion where Chriſts Government of his Church is, or what the Government of Chriſts Church is, when they ſee Chriſt hath always had, hath now, and undoubtedly will always have his Inſtruments of his goodneſs, the fruits of his Spirit, both in ruling, governing, and the reſt of that kind, and alſo of obeying, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and ſerving, for the comfort and ſociety of his Church and people in the way of their pilgrimage, and for his own glory? As he had <hi>Abraham</hi> his Inſtrument, and his moſt publique Inſtrument, then, of his Church, to govern and teach, by him, the Church in his houſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> and thoſe that belonged to him: And <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> his Inſtruments, to govern, teach and take ſuch other offices of his (as he pleaſed) to make them his fitted Inſtruments in his Church, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And after <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Judges, <hi>David</hi> the King, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and others, to judg and govern (being his Inſtruments:) And afterward his Apoſtles, Biſhops, or Overſeers, Presbyters, Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, and (by whatſoever names or titles they were called) many other his Inſtruments of his goodneſs of ordering, governing and teaching his Church: And whileſt goodneſs appeared or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ruling, governing, ordering, Lawgiving, judging, teaching and <note place="margin">Iſai. 8, 20.

            <p>Good ruling and governing is Chriſts ruling and governing, and good obeying is Chriſts obeying; they are the good works of Chriſt wrought by his Spirit in man, and brought forth of his Spirit by or with the fitted Inſtrument of man; and no doubt but they that have the Spirit of Chriſt, their conſcience will tell them, that unto good ruling, governing, teaching, ordering and commanding, it pleaſeth Chriſt well, that there be good obeying and ſubmitting, by or through whatſoever means and Inſtruments Chriſt holds forth the ſame, as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>If Independents, and thoſe with them, acknowledg that Chriſt hath power to good only, and doth all good in man only by his holy Spirit ſent to man, of ruling and obeying, and whatſoever elſe; and that man himſelf of himſelf can do no good; and that the good ruling, governing, Lawgiving, judging, ordering and teaching, done of Chriſt, by and with his Inſtruments, fitted of him, by his Spirit, given them, for the good, comfort, and ſociety of his people in the way of their pilgrimage, is the Rule and Government of Chriſt himſelf, though with the Inſtrument of man, and of his pleaſure and grace accounted mans by him (as he doth all manner of his righteous and good works, love, joy, peace, &amp;c. done of him by his Spirit in them) which he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118157:102"/>
of his grace, to make his Inſtruments of the ſame, and of his grace, as appeareth in the word of grace, nameth and calleth them theirs: Then there will be no queſtion of Chriſts Government of his Church, nor of the obedience, ſubmiſſion and ſervice due to his Government, without which the queſtion is not, nor will be ſatisfied with anſwer: and in truth it is the ſame of righteouſneſs only, <hi>that giveth light to them that ſit in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death, to guide their feet in the way of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Legaliſts ſtrive much about this undecided queſtion of Chriſts Government of his Church, againſt the Independents, Anabaptiſts, and Browniſts, much of the ſame way; but being miſled by the Spirit of Antichriſt, they prevail little; for all their Arguments are but mans, as Antiquities, Cuſtoms, humane Reaſons, conveniences and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, the letter of the Scripture of Laws and Ordinances; but they draw not ſo deep as out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, the fountain of Grace.</p>
            <p>They ſay, Though Chriſt hath power over all, and hath Almighty power, yet man hath power of his own unto good, as unto evil; and that man hath power of his own to get to himſelf habitual vertues, by ſtudying, laboring, practiſing, and endeavoring the ſame.</p>
            <p>And they ſay and hold forth, That although Chriſt be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that is, ſupream King, ſupream Prince and Lord, &amp;c. yet there are Kings, Princes and Lords upon Earth; and that Kings, Princes and Lords upon Earth, are Kings, Princes and Lords of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Titles are their own, of their own right, property and intereſt; and that they by their own power, rule, govern, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and order, their people under them, and of their own right; and that by their own power and right they do and may command the whole Church and people under them, and all ought to obey and do ſervice to them, and ſubmit to their power and command, as their Kings, Princes and Lords abſolute; and that through this their power, ruling, governing, Lawgiving, judging, and the reſt, the people have their peace, ſafety, ſociety and communion; and that they have right to honor for the ſame.</p>
            <p>But theſe and ſuch attributions to man, favour too much of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that diſ-throneth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and exalteth man into the Throne of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no man that is a King, Prieſt, or Prophet of himſelf; <hi>Chriſt</hi> only is ſo of himſelf by the eternal Unction; man is nothing of good himſelf: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man think himſelf to be ſomewhat when as he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf in his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>

            <p>And ſo, as the good works of Kings, and Rulers, and Governors, are not theirs, but Chriſts; or theirs only by account and of grace, as they are the inſtruments of Chriſt: So their Titles of Kings, Rulers, Governors, Lawgivers, Judges, Teachers, and the reſt, are not mans Titles by any merit, intereſt, or property, they have to them, or in any of them, but only of grace and account; as <hi>Paul,</hi> called an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, acknowledged he had no property or intereſt to that Title of <hi>Apostle,</hi> but by account and grace; <hi>By the grace of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am that I am:</hi> I am an <hi>Apostle,</hi> but by the grace of God it is that I <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 10</note> am ſo; not of my ſelf, my property or intereſt thereto.</p>
            <p>Man is not of any property King or Lord over Gods heritage. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 3</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is Chriſt alone that is of property, due, right, merit, and intereſt, King, Prieſt, and Prophet, Lord, Ruler, Governor, Lawgiver, Judg, Teacher; and men only by account and grace ſo called and honored of Chriſt: and they all <hi>to caſt their crowns</hi> down to the ground <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him;</hi> and to give and aſcribe <hi>all honor, glory, power, might, and</hi>

            <p>Then they muſt needs conclude, That this is Chriſts Government of his Church, which is made, done, and wrought by his Spirit, by or with ſuch fitted inſtruments of men, as are held forth in the word of Grace and Teſtimonies, and guided by his Spirit (as he pleaſeth,) having evidence of the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, righteouſneſs, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> always accompanying the ſame. <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as Chriſt governeth his Church upon Earth by divers his fitted inſtruments of his Spirit, called by him with his own names and titles, <hi>Kings, Princes, Lords, Rulers, Governors, Lawgivers, Judges, Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Overſeers, Preſbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders, Pastors, Teachers, Deacons, Ministers, Helpers,</hi> or whatſoever other names menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Word of Grace, in ſuch place and office of his, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to make them fit for by his Spirit of Grace, to be his inſtruments in his compleat Government of his Church, and Republique thereof.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt being the Head of his Church, and being the Head of

the whole body of his Church in all things upon Earth, thus governed by him (as the Apoſtle ſaith) He hath undoubtedly his inſtruments of <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 26</note> his Headſhip of his Church ſevered into many National Churches, to which his Government belongeth: And certainly, to that inſtrument of Chriſt upon Earth, which he hath fitted and placed for the firſt and principal of his Government in his ordination and ſubordination, Chriſt is well pleaſed to account to him his honor and title of Head of that National, Political, and Parochial Church. So <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, accounted the ſame to <hi>Saul,</hi> being made King; <hi>When</hi>

Or ſecondly, <hi>That Chriſt is a co-operator with man in the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thirdly, <hi>That Chriſt is the Instrument of man in the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or fourthly, <hi>That man is the Helper of Chriſt in the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or fifthly, <hi>That man is the co-operator with Chriſt in the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or ſixthly, <hi>That man is the Instrument only of Chriſt in the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> If Chriſt be the Helper of man in the work, then is man the beginner and maſter of the work, the principal worker or workman of the work, and man is exalted above Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt be a co-operator with man, then Chriſt is only a partner with man in the work, and ſo Chriſt hath only his ſhare with man of the work, Chriſt is diſthroned.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt be the Inſtrument of man in the work, then Chriſt is not the doer of the work, but man is the doer; the work is wholly mans: for the Inſtrument is only fitted, guided, and acted by the workman; and ſo is Chriſt only fitted, guided, and acted by man, if Chriſt be his Inſtrument: man is exalted above Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If man be the Helper of Chriſt in the good work, then Chriſt is not able and ſtrong enough, or not ſufficient to do and perform the good deed, but hath need of mans Help: ſo man is exalted, which <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 11 Gal. 6. 3</note> is <hi>nothing,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith.)</p>
            <p>If man be a co-operator with Chriſt in the good work, then man may of right claim a ſhare in the work, and of the work that is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; and ſo man hath ſomething to boaſt of, contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16</note> and man is exalted.</p>
            <p>If man be only (by grace) a fitted Inſtrument of Chriſt in his good and righteous work (as he pleaſeth,) then Chriſt is the only doer and workman of the work, and the work is wholy Chriſts; the honor wholy belongeth to him: and man is ſo made graciouſly his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo of the praiſe and glory of his grace; eſpecially for Chriſts accounting and imputing his own work, and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to man; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs without works of his own.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ro. 4. 6, 7</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this agreeth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Give, or yield your members instruments of righteouſneſs unto God:</hi> And again, <hi>Yet it was not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6 13 1 Cor. 15. 10 Mat. 10. 20</note> 
               <hi>I that labored, but the grace of God with me,</hi> (meaning in his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.) So Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>It is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of the Father in you;</hi> you are but the inſtruments.</p>
            <p>So <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My tongue is the pen of a ready writer;</hi> that is, the <note place="margin">Pſal. 45 1</note>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:118157:105"/>
inſtrument of the Spirit of God, as the pen is of the writer.</p>
            <p>The pen writeth not without the writer, no more can man do the good thing without Chriſt the doer; as Chriſt ſaith in the Text, <hi>Without me you can do nothing;</hi> no, not being the branches of the Vine, the Elect of God: The branch cannot bear and hold forth the fruit without the Vine and ſpirits thereof.</p>
            <p>This way Chriſt indeed is exalted, as God exalted him; and any the other ways not ſo, but diſ-throned.</p>
